## 1. Opportunity Assessment

### Market Size
- **~770 qualifying cities** in the United States (50k-1M population)
- Per the US Census Bureau, approximately 779 cities have populations over 50,000, minus 9-12 cities over 1 million
- These mid-sized cities represent ideal targets: large enough for search volume, small enough to rank competitively

### Search Intent Analysis
Based on research, people searching after car accidents use three primary intent categories:

**A. Informational (Early Stage)**
- "what to do after car accident"
- "do I need a lawyer after car accident"
- "insurance lowball offer what to do"
- "how long do I have to file claim"

**B. Navigational (Mid Stage)**
- "car accident lawyer near me"
- "car accident attorney [city]"
- "personal injury lawyer [city]"
- "free consultation accident lawyer"

**C. Transactional (High Intent)**
- "car accident lawyer free consultation [city]"
- "contingency fee accident attorney [city]"
- "sue insurance company [city]"
- "rear ended need lawyer [city]"

### Competitive Landscape
- Major players: Morgan & Morgan, Avvo, FindLaw, Yelp
- Mid-tier: Regional law firm directories
- **Opportunity:** Educational content focus differentiates from sales-heavy competitors

**H1:** `Car Accident Help in [City], [State]`

**Lead Paragraph:** (Educational, empathetic, includes urgency)
```
If you've been in a car accident in [City], you're not alone—and you don't have to navigate the insurance process by yourself. Whether you were rear-ended, T-boned, or involved in a multi-car collision, understanding your rights under [State] law is the first step to getting fair compensation for your vehicle damage and injuries.
```

#### B. State-Specific Legal Information

Dynamic content pulled from state data:
- Fault system explanation (at-fault vs no-fault)
- Statute of limitations (CREATE URGENCY)
- Comparative negligence rules
- Minimum insurance requirements
- PIP requirements if applicable

**Urgency Box:**
```
⚠️ Important: [State] has a [X-year] statute of limitations for personal injury claims. If you were injured, the clock is already ticking. Evidence disappears, witnesses forget details, and insurance companies count on you waiting too long.
```

**H2:** `Car Accidents in [City]: What You're Facing`

- City-specific traffic patterns
- Dangerous roads/intersections in the area

Content points:
1. **Evidence Preservation** - Traffic camera footage gets deleted, witness memories fade, vehicle damage gets repaired
2. **Statute of Limitations** - State-specific deadline creates urgency
3. **Insurance Tactics** - Companies exploit delays to dispute injuries and lowball settlements
4. **No Upfront Cost** - Contingency fee means no risk to you
5. **Government Claims Exception** - If hit by government vehicle, only 6 months to file

**Quote Box:**
```
"The sooner you hire a car accident lawyer, the sooner they can work on getting evidence before it becomes unavailable. Traffic camera footage, surveillance footage, and other types of evidence could get destroyed or erased as time passes after your accident."
```

#### E. What a Contingency Lawyer Does for You
**H2:** `Free Consultation, No Win = No Fee`

Educational content about contingency arrangements:
- What "contingency" means (they only get paid if you win)

- What's covered: investigation, negotiation, litigation
- Why this levels the playing field against insurance companies

#### F. Common Scenarios Section
