    introText: "Washington, DC, the nation's capital, presents unique driving challenges with its mix of federal workers, tourists, and residents. The city's famous L'Enfant street plan features numerous traffic circles and diagonal avenues that create complex intersections. Motorcades, protests, and special events frequently disrupt traffic. The Metro system handles many commuters, but surface traffic remains heavy. Accidents involving federal vehicles, diplomatic cars, and rideshare services add complexity to claims.",
