## Rear-Ended by an Uninsured Driver

Being rear-ended is frustrating enough. When the driver who hit you has no insurance, your stress multiplies. Understanding your options for recovering damages from an uninsured driver helps you navigate this challenging situation.

> [!INFO] About 12-14% of drivers nationwide are uninsured. In some states, rates exceed 25%. Your own insurance coverage becomes critical when the at-fault driver can't pay.

## Immediate Steps

### At the Scene

1. **Call police** - Documentation essential
2. **Get their information anyway** - Name, license, address, phone
3. **Document thoroughly** - Photos of everything
4. **Get witnesses** - Their testimony matters more without insurance
5. **Note their vehicle** - License plate, make, model, color
6. **Don't accept promises** - "I'll pay you directly" rarely works

### Verify Insurance Status

At the scene:
- Ask for insurance card
- Note if card is expired
- Get policy number anyway
- Verify later with insurance company

**Note:** They may have insurance but claim they don't to avoid using it. Always verify.

## Your Uninsured Motorist Coverage

### What Is UM/UIM Coverage?

Your own policy may include:
- **Uninsured Motorist (UM):** Covers when other driver has no insurance
- **Underinsured Motorist (UIM):** Covers when their limits are insufficient
- Combined UM/UIM in some states

### What UM Covers

Typically covers:
- Your medical expenses
- Lost wages
- Pain and suffering
- Passenger injuries
- Sometimes property damage

### UM Coverage Limits

Your limits may be:
- Same as liability limits
- Lower limits (if allowed in state)
- Stacked (if multiple vehicles)
- Subject to deductible

> [!TIP] Review your UM/UIM coverage now - before you need it. In states where it's optional, consider adding or increasing it. It's typically inexpensive and invaluable when needed.

## Filing a UM Claim

### Process Overview

1. **Report accident to your insurer** - Immediately
2. **Explain other driver is uninsured** - Provide documentation
3. **Provide police report** - Shows other driver's status
4. **Document your damages** - Medical bills, lost wages, etc.
5. **Your insurer adjusts claim** - Like any injury claim

### Your Insurer's Investigation
