## Rear-Ended While Turning

Being rear-ended while making a turn creates a unique liability scenario. Whether you were turning left, right, or into a driveway, the fault analysis depends on your actions, the other driver's actions, and specific circumstances.

> [!INFO] Rear-end collisions during turns often involve shared fault. The turning driver may bear some responsibility if they stopped unexpectedly or signaled improperly.

## Types of Turning Rear-End Collisions

### Left Turn Situations

**Waiting to turn left:**
- Stopped in traffic lane
- Waiting for oncoming traffic
- Hit from behind by following driver

**Mid-turn collision:**
- Started turning
- Stopped mid-turn (for pedestrian, etc.)
- Hit while crossing traffic

### Right Turn Situations

**Slowing for turn:**
- Reduced speed for turn
- Following driver didn't anticipate
- Hit while slowing or stopped

**Turning into traffic:**
- Made turn onto new road
- Following car from new road hit you
- Speed differential issue

### Driveway/Parking Lot Turns

**Turning into driveway:**
- Slowed to turn
- Following driver not paying attention
- Rear-ended while entering driveway

**Turning into parking lot:**
- Similar to driveway situation
- May be lower speed impact
- Often results in whiplash

## Fault Analysis by Scenario

### Scenario 1: Rear-Ended Waiting for Left Turn

**Situation:** You're stopped in the travel lane with blinker on, waiting to turn left. Car behind hits you.

**Typical Fault:**
- Following car: 80-100%
- You: 0-20%

**Their Arguments:**
- You stopped in traffic lane
- No turn lane available
- Blocking traffic

**Your Defense:**
- Legal to wait for left turn
- Had signal on
- Maintained position
- They should have been watching

### Scenario 2: Stopped Mid-Turn

**Situation:** You began left turn, stopped for pedestrian, rear-ended by following car.

**Typical Fault:**
- Following car: Usually 100%
- You: Rarely any

**Reasoning:**
- You yielded properly to pedestrian
- Following driver should not have assumed you'd complete turn
- Pedestrian had right of way

### Scenario 3: Sudden Stop for Turn

**Situation:** You braked suddenly to make a turn you almost missed.

**Typical Fault:**
- You: 20-50%
- Following car: 50-80%

**Shared Fault Factors:**
- Your sudden braking contributed
- But following driver still should have maintained distance
- Your signal usage matters

### Scenario 4: Right Turn - Slowing Down

**Situation:** You slowed to make right turn, rear-ended.

**Typical Fault:**
- Following car: Usually 90-100%
- You: 0-10%

**Their Potential Arguments:**
- You slowed too suddenly
- Didn't signal properly

**Your Defense:**
- Must slow for turn
- Following driver should anticipate

> [!TIP] Always use your turn signal early - at least 100 feet before turning (more on highways). Early signaling protects you from claims that you braked unexpectedly.

## Key Factors in Fault Determination

### Signal Usage

Your turn signal is crucial:

| Signal Status | Impact on Fault |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Signal on early | Strongly in your favor |
| Signal on late | May share fault |
| No signal | May share significant fault |
| Signal, then cancelled | Confusing - may share fault |

### Stopping Location

Where you stopped matters:

| Location | Fault Consideration |
|----------|---------------------|
| Dedicated turn lane | Strongly in your favor |
| Regular traffic lane | Still generally OK |
| Blocking intersection | May share fault |
| Past the turn | May share fault |

### Duration of Stop

How long you were stopped:
- Brief stop (yielding to traffic) - normal
- Extended stop (excessive caution) - may be questioned
- Stopped with no apparent reason - may share fault

### Speed Differential

- You slowing gradually: In your favor
- You braking hard suddenly: May share fault
- Following driver speeding: In your favor

## Common Defense Arguments

### When They Blame You

**"You stopped suddenly"**
Your counter:
- I was making a legal turn
- Signal was on
- Must slow/stop to turn safely
- They should have maintained safe distance

**"There was no reason to stop"**
Your counter:
- Waiting for oncoming traffic (left turn)
- Pedestrian was present
- Traffic conditions required stop
- Turning requires slowing

**"Your brake lights weren't on"**
Your counter:
- Get lights tested and documented
- Stopping requires brake lights
- They should see vehicle ahead regardless

**"You cut me off"**
Your counter:
- I was in the lane making a turn
- Signal indicated my intentions
- Did not change lanes into them

## Evidence for Turning Rear-Ends

### What Helps Your Case

- Functioning turn signal
- Working brake lights
- Dash cam showing signal/stop
- Witness testimony
- Skid marks (their braking)
- Police report documenting turn signal

### What Hurts Your Case

- No turn signal
- Signal activated late
- Sudden unexpected braking
- Past your turn when hit
- In wrong lane for turn

### Damage Patterns

Damage can indicate:
- Offset impact = you were partially into turn
- Center impact = straight on collision
- Angle of damage = direction of impact
- Height differential = truck vs. car issues

## Injuries in Turning Rear-Ends

### Unique Injury Considerations

If your head was turned at impact:
- Worse whiplash risk
- Neck already rotated = more strain
- May cause different injury pattern
- Could affect shoulder, jaw

### Impact Position

| Your Position | Injury Consideration |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Looking forward | Standard whiplash |
| Head turned left | Worse neck rotation injury |
| Head turned right | Same risk |
| Checking mirror | Neck partially turned |

## Filing Your Claim

### Property Damage

Standard process:
- File with their insurance
- Or use your collision
- Document all damage
- Get proper repair estimate

### Injury Claim

If injured:
- Seek immediate medical attention
- Document turning position
- Note if head was turned
- Follow treatment plan

### Negotiating Fault Percentage

If they claim shared fault:
- Emphasize signal usage
- Show lawful turning position
- Document reason for stop (if applicable)
- Challenge their speed/attention

> [!WARNING] Insurance adjusters may try to assign you 10-20% fault just for "stopping in traffic." Push back with evidence of proper signaling and lawful turn procedures.

## Special Situations

### Left Turn Accidents (T-Bone vs. Rear-End)

Different from T-bone accidents:
- T-bone: Oncoming car hits your side
- Rear-end: Following car hits your back

Rear-end while turning left:
- You were waiting/turning properly
- Car behind is at fault
- Not the same as left-turn yield accidents

### Right Turn on Red

If rear-ended while:
- Stopped at red before turning right
- Following car expected you to turn
- You were waiting for pedestrian/traffic

Fault: Usually on following driver - they shouldn't assume you'll turn.

### Multiple Impact Scenarios

Rear-ended, then hit by oncoming traffic:
- Initial rear driver caused chain
- Complex liability
- May involve multiple claims

## State-Specific Rules

### Turn Requirements

Most states require:
- Signal at least 100 feet before turn
- Yield right of way before turning
- Complete turn from proper lane
- Not block intersection unnecessarily

### Comparative Negligence

If found partially at fault:
- Your recovery reduced by your percentage
- Modified comparative states: Bar if over 50/51%
- Pure comparative: Recover even if mostly at fault
- Contributory negligence: Any fault bars recovery (5 states)

## Key Takeaways

- Rear-end while turning typically favors the turning driver
- Turn signal usage is critical evidence
- Following driver should maintain safe distance for stops
- Some shared fault possible if turn was sudden or poorly signaled
- Document your signal and stopping position
- Head position at impact may affect injuries
- Push back against automatic fault assignment for "stopping"
- Different from left-turn-yield accidents where turner cuts off traffic
- State comparative negligence rules affect recovery if fault is shared
