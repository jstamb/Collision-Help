## Rear-Ended While Stopped at a Red Light

Being rear-ended while lawfully stopped at a red light is one of the clearest liability scenarios in car accident law. You were doing everything right - stopped at a traffic signal - and someone hit you from behind.

> [!INFO] If you were rear-ended while stopped at a red light, the other driver is almost always 100% at fault. Your challenge is documentation and getting fair compensation.

## Why Fault Is Clear

### Your Legal Position

When stopped at a red light, you were:
- Obeying traffic signals
- Maintaining lawful position
- Stationary (not moving)
- Not contributing to the collision

### The Other Driver's Failure

The driver who hit you failed to:
- Pay attention to traffic
- Maintain safe following distance
- Stop in time
- Anticipate stopped vehicles

**Result:** They're at fault, period.

## Exceptions (Rare)

### When You Might Share Fault

Extremely rare situations:

| Situation | Your Potential Fault |
|-----------|---------------------|
| You were stopped past the line | Minimal, if any |
| Your brake lights weren't working | Possible 10-20% |
| You rolled backward into them | Possible 50-100% |
| You stopped suddenly at yellow | Usually none |

> [!TIP] Even if your brake lights were out, courts typically find the following driver should have been paying enough attention to see a stopped vehicle regardless of brake lights.

## What to Do at the Scene

### Immediate Steps

1. **Check for injuries** - Call 911 if needed
2. **Move if safe** - Get out of traffic if possible
3. **Turn on hazards** - Protect the scene
4. **Call police** - Always for rear-end collisions
5. **Don't admit anything** - Just exchange info

### Documentation Checklist

**Photos to take:**
- Damage to your rear bumper/vehicle
- Damage to their front end
- Their license plate
- The traffic light (showing red)
- Skid marks (or lack thereof)
- Overall scene/intersection
- Both vehicles' positions

**Information to collect:**
- Other driver's name and contact
- Their insurance company and policy number
- Their driver's license number
- Witness names and phone numbers
- Police report number

### What to Tell Police

Be factual:
- "I was stopped at the red light"
- "I was hit from behind"
- "I didn't see them coming"
- Don't speculate about their speed or distraction

## Common Injuries

### Why Red Light Rear-Ends Cause Injuries

- You're completely stationary
- No warning to brace yourself
- Head snaps back then forward (whiplash)
- Full force of impact absorbed

### Typical Injuries

| Injury | Symptoms | Timeline |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Whiplash | Neck pain, stiffness | May take 24-72 hours to appear |
| Back strain | Lower back pain | Same day to weeks later |
| Concussion | Headache, confusion | Immediate to hours later |
| Shoulder injury | Pain, limited motion | Often delayed |
| TMJ | Jaw pain, clicking | Weeks to months later |

### Get Medical Attention

Even if you feel fine:
- Adrenaline masks pain
- Soft tissue injuries appear later
- Documentation protects your claim
- Creates medical record link to accident

> [!WARNING] Insurance companies look for gaps in treatment. If you wait weeks to see a doctor, they'll argue you weren't really injured in the accident.

## Filing Your Claim

### Against Their Insurance

**What to file for:**
- Vehicle damage repair
- Medical expenses
- Lost wages
- Rental car
- Pain and suffering

### Timeline

| Step | Typical Timeframe |
|------|-------------------|
| File claim | Within 1-3 days |
| Adjuster contact | 1-3 business days |
| Vehicle inspection | 3-7 days |
| Repair authorization | 1-2 weeks |
| Injury claim | Ongoing until treatment complete |

### What to Expect

The at-fault driver's insurance will:
- Accept liability (usually quickly)
- Arrange vehicle inspection
- Authorize repairs at their rate
- Try to minimize injury claim
- Offer quick settlement

## Vehicle Damage Claims

### Getting Your Car Fixed

**Your options:**
1. Use their insurance's direct repair program
2. Choose your own shop
3. Get independent estimate

**Recommendation:** Get your own estimate before accepting theirs.

### Hidden Damage

Rear-end collisions often cause:
- Frame damage
- Suspension damage
- Trunk alignment issues
- Electrical problems
- Hidden structural damage

**Important:** Insist on thorough inspection. Damage beyond bumper is common.

### If Your Car Is Totaled

Even low-speed rear-ends can total older vehicles:
- Bumper + sensors + cameras = expensive
- If repairs > 70-80% of value, often totaled
- Review valuation carefully
- Negotiate if undervalued

## Injury Claim Strategy

### Don't Settle Too Fast

Insurance will try to close quickly:
- Initial lowball offer
- "Sign this release" pressure
- Before you know full injury extent

**Your response:** "I'm still treating and not ready to settle."

### When to Settle

Wait until you know:
- Full extent of injuries
- All medical bills
- Whether you've fully recovered
- Any permanent effects
- All lost wages

### What You Can Claim

| Damages Type | Examples |
|--------------|----------|
| Economic | Medical bills, lost wages, future treatment |
| Non-economic | Pain and suffering, inconvenience |
| Property | Vehicle damage, personal items in car |

## Dealing With Insurance Tactics

### Recorded Statement

They'll ask for one:
- You don't have to give one to THEIR insurance
- If you do, stick to basic facts
- Don't speculate about injuries
- Don't guess about speed or cause

### Quick Settlement Offers

Red flags:
- Offer before you've seen doctor
- "We'll handle everything, just sign here"
- Pressure to settle immediately
- Amount seems too good (usually isn't)

### Surveillance

For injury claims:
- They may follow you
- They check social media
- Be honest about limitations
- Don't exaggerate but don't hide symptoms

## When You Need a Lawyer

### Consider an Attorney If:

- Significant injuries
- Surgery required
- Extended time off work
- Dispute over injury causation
- Insurance lowballing substantially
- Permanent injury or disability
- Offers seem inadequate

### Attorney Fees

Personal injury attorneys typically:
- Work on contingency (no upfront cost)
- Take 33-40% of settlement
- Handle all negotiation
- May significantly increase recovery

## Special Situations

### Hit By Uninsured Driver

If they don't have insurance:
- Use your uninsured motorist coverage
- File claim with YOUR insurance
- May need to sue them personally
- Getting paid is challenging

### Hit and Run

If they fled:
- Call police immediately
- Note any vehicle details
- Look for witnesses
- Check for cameras nearby
- Use your UM/UIM coverage

### Commercial Vehicle Hit You

If a truck or company vehicle:
- Company is usually liable
- Larger insurance policies
