## Atlanta Metro Dangerous Roads

### Most Dangerous Atlanta Freeways

| Freeway | Daily Volume | Key Hazards |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| I-285 | 250,000+ | Speed when clear, gridlock otherwise |
| I-75/85 Connector | 350,000+ | Volume, merging |
| I-20 | 200,000+ | East-west bottleneck |
| GA-400 | 200,000+ | Northside speeds |
| I-85 | 220,000+ | Northeast corridor congestion |

### Atlanta's Gridlock Problem

Atlanta consistently ranks among worst US cities for:
- Total hours lost to congestion
- Cost of congestion per driver
- Commute time unpredictability
- Road rage incidents

**Contributing factors:**
- Sprawling metro area
- Limited public transit
- Highway-dependent infrastructure
- Rapid population growth
- Insufficient road capacity

### Dangerous Atlanta Intersections

Based on crash data:
1. **I-285 & I-85 North** - "Spaghetti Junction"
2. **I-75/85 at I-20** - Grady Curve
3. **GA-400 at I-285** - Sandy Springs
4. **I-85 at Clairmont** - Interchange complexity
5. **I-20 at I-285 West** - Six Flags area

## Rural Georgia Dangerous Roads

### Highway Hazards

Many fatal crashes in Georgia occur on:
- US-1 through rural south Georgia
- US-41 through central Georgia
- US-84 across south Georgia
- State routes through agricultural areas

**Rural road risks:**
- High speeds on two-lane roads
- Head-on collision potential
- Limited lighting at night
- Deer and wildlife crossings
- Agricultural equipment

### South Georgia Specifics

- Long, straight roads encouraging speeding
- Limited emergency response times
- Distance from trauma centers
- Farm equipment sharing roads
- Timber trucks on rural routes

## Georgia Weather Hazards

### Ice Storms

Atlanta and North Georgia are particularly vulnerable:
- Rare but dangerous ice events
- Infrastructure not designed for winter
- Drivers inexperienced with ice
- Limited salt and sand supplies
- Hills make conditions worse

**2014 "Snowpocalypse":**
- 2 inches of snow paralyzed Atlanta
- Thousands stranded overnight
- Hundreds of accidents
- Schools, businesses closed

> [!TIP] When ice or snow is forecast in Georgia, the safest option is to stay home. The infrastructure and drivers are not prepared for winter conditions.

### Severe Thunderstorms

Georgia sees significant storm activity:
- Heavy rain reducing visibility
- Flash flooding on roads
- Hydroplaning on interstates
- Hail damage while driving
- Tornado risk (especially spring)

### Fog

Morning fog is common in valleys and near rivers:
- Reduced visibility on rural roads
- Particularly dangerous on bridges
- Often dissipates by mid-morning
- More common fall through spring

## Georgia-Specific Accident Statistics

| Statistic | Georgia Data |
|-----------|--------------|
| Annual traffic deaths | 1,600+ |
| Deaths per 100M miles | 1.37 |
| Atlanta metro fatalities | 40% of state total |
| Speed-related deaths | 25% |
| Alcohol-related deaths | 23% |
