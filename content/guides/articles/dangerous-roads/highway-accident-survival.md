## Highway Accident Survival Guide

Being involved in an accident on a high-speed highway is terrifying. The immediate moments after a crash—with cars speeding past—are among the most dangerous. Here's how to survive and protect yourself.

> [!WARNING] Secondary crashes (being hit while stopped on the highway) kill hundreds of people each year. Getting to safety is your first priority.

## Immediate Actions: The First 60 Seconds

### 1. Assess the Situation

Before moving:
- Check yourself for injuries
- Look at other passengers
- Assess if your vehicle is drivable
- Check mirrors for approaching traffic
- Smell for gasoline or see smoke

### 2. Turn On Hazard Lights

**Immediately** activate your hazard flashers:
- Alerts approaching traffic
- Works even if engine is off
- Universal signal for distress
- Visible from long distances

### 3. Decide: Stay or Exit

**STAY in your vehicle if:**
- You're in active traffic lanes
- Vehicle is not on fire
- No smell of gasoline
- Exiting would put you in traffic's path

**EXIT your vehicle if:**
- Fire or smoke is present
- Strong gasoline smell
- Vehicle is in danger of being hit again
- You can safely reach the shoulder

## Getting to Safety

### If You Can Move Your Vehicle

1. **Signal and move right** - Get completely off the roadway
2. **Pull far onto shoulder** - As far from traffic as possible
3. **Don't stop in travel lanes** - Even damaged cars can often limp to safety
4. **Exit on the right side** - Away from traffic

### If Your Vehicle Won't Move

1. **Stay buckled** until you can safely exit
2. **Exit on the passenger side** (away from traffic)
3. **Move behind guardrail** immediately
4. **Walk away from the vehicle** at least 100 feet
5. **Never stand behind or in front** of your disabled vehicle

### Where to Wait for Help

**Best locations:**
- Behind a guardrail or barrier
- Up an embankment away from the road
- At an emergency pullout area
- Off the roadway completely

**Never:**
- Stand on the roadway
- Walk in traffic lanes
- Stay in your vehicle in an active lane
- Stand directly behind your disabled vehicle

## Setting Up Warning Signals

### If Safe to Do So

Place warning devices if you can do so safely:
1. **Emergency triangles** - 100 feet, 200 feet, 300 feet behind vehicle
2. **Flares** - Provide better nighttime visibility
3. **Open trunk/hood** - Additional visual cue something is wrong

> [!TIP] Keep emergency triangles in your vehicle. They fold flat and can save your life by warning approaching traffic.

### At Night

Visibility is critical:
- Leave all vehicle lights on
- Wear reflective materials if available
- Use your phone's flashlight
- Stay completely off the roadway

## Calling for Help

### 911 Call Information

Be prepared to provide:
- Highway name and direction (I-95 North, US-101 South)
- Mile marker (posted on small green signs)
- Exit number (just passed or approaching)
- Number of vehicles involved
- Injuries if any
- If you're in a safe location

### What Dispatch Will Ask

- Your exact location
- Nature of injuries
- Vehicle descriptions
- If anyone is trapped
- If there are hazards (fire, spilled cargo)

## Common Highway Accident Scenarios

### Rear-End Collision

If you're hit from behind:
1. Foot OFF brake to absorb impact
2. Check for traffic before exiting
3. Don't confront the other driver in traffic
4. Exchange information on the shoulder

### Spin Out or Loss of Control

If your vehicle is spinning:
1. Don't panic or overcorrect
2. Steer in the direction you want to go
3. Avoid braking hard (can increase spin)
4. Let the vehicle come to rest naturally
5. Assess surroundings before moving

### Multi-Vehicle Pileup

In a chain-reaction crash:
1. Stay in your vehicle if no fire
2. Protect yourself from additional impacts
3. Exit away from traffic flow if safe
4. Help others only if you can do so safely
5. Be aware more vehicles may be coming

### Vehicle Fire

If you see fire or smell smoke:
1. Pull over immediately if driving
2. Exit the vehicle instantly
3. Move at least 100 feet away
4. Call 911
5. Never open the hood of a burning car

> [!WARNING] Vehicle fires can intensify rapidly and cause explosions. Distance is your protection.

## Highway-Specific Dangers

### Secondary Crashes

The biggest post-accident danger:
- Distracted drivers may not see stopped vehicles
- High-speed traffic has little reaction time
- Rubbernecking reduces attention
- Darkness multiplies the risk

**Prevention:**
- Get off the roadway immediately
- Use all available warning devices
- Don't walk on the highway
- Wait behind barriers

### Truck Traffic

Commercial trucks pose extra dangers:
- Longer stopping distances
- Wider blind spots
- More severe impact force
- Cargo spill hazards

**If near a truck:**
- Assume they can't see you
- Give them extra space
- Watch for shifting cargo

### Weather Factors

Conditions that increase highway danger:
- Rain reducing visibility and traction
- Fog hiding stopped vehicles
- Ice making stopping impossible
- Sun glare blinding drivers

## What NOT to Do After a Highway Accident

### Dangerous Mistakes

- **Walking to survey damage** while traffic passes
- **Standing in travel lanes** for any reason
- **Chasing debris** that blew into the roadway
- **Waiting in your disabled vehicle** in a travel lane
- **Approaching angry drivers** in traffic
- **Leaving the scene** before police arrive (unless for safety)

## Emergency Equipment Every Driver Needs

### Essential Items

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Emergency triangles | Warn approaching traffic |
| Flashlight | Nighttime visibility |
| Reflective vest | Make yourself visible |
| First aid kit | Treat minor injuries |
| Phone charger | Maintain communication |
| Blanket | Warmth while waiting |

### Nice to Have

- Flares (better visibility than triangles)
- Fire extinguisher
- Water bottles
- Protein bars
- Rain poncho

## After You're Safe: Documentation

Once everyone is safe and help is coming:

1. **Photograph the scene** from a safe location
2. **Note the mile marker** or exit number
3. **Get witness information** if witnesses are present
4. **Document vehicle positions** before they're moved
5. **Write down what happened** while memory is fresh

## Long-Term Considerations

### Medical Attention

Even if you feel fine:
- Adrenaline masks injury symptoms
- Internal injuries may not be apparent
- Whiplash symptoms often delayed 24-72 hours
- Documentation establishes injury timeline

### Your Insurance Claim

Highway accidents often involve:
- Multiple vehicles
- Serious injuries
- Commercial vehicles
- Government entity roads

These factors can complicate your claim—start documentation immediately.
