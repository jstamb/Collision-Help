## Most Dangerous Roads in Arizona

Arizona's extreme desert environment creates unique driving hazards found nowhere else in America. From dust storms that reduce visibility to zero, to scorching heat that causes tire blowouts, understanding these dangers is essential for safe travel.

> [!WARNING] Arizona's monsoon season (July-September) brings sudden dust storms called haboobs that can reduce visibility to zero in seconds.

## Arizona Weather Hazards

### Dust Storms (Haboobs)

Arizona's most unique driving hazard:

**What happens:**
- Walls of dust 1-3 miles high
- Wind speeds up to 60 mph
- Visibility drops to zero instantly
- Can last 15-30 minutes

**What to do:**
1. **Pull off the road completely** - Get as far right as possible
2. **Turn off all lights** - So others don't follow you thinking you're on the road
3. **Set parking brake** - Keep foot off brake pedal
4. **Stay in vehicle** - Wait for storm to pass
5. **Never drive into a dust storm** - You can't see what's ahead

> [!TIP] Remember: "Pull Aside, Stay Alive" - Arizona's official dust storm safety message.

### Extreme Heat

Summer driving in Arizona requires:
- Checking tire pressure (heat increases pressure)
- Carrying extra water (for you and radiator)
- Never leaving anyone in a parked car
- Being aware of overheating vehicle signs
- Knowing tire blowout risks increase dramatically

**Heat-related road dangers:**
- Pavement can exceed 150°F
- Tire blowouts from heat and pavement
- Vehicle overheating
- Driver fatigue from AC strain
- Melting pavement in extreme cases

### Monsoon Season (July-September)

Arizona's monsoon brings:
- Sudden, violent thunderstorms
- Flash flooding in washes
- Dust storms preceding rain
- Reduced visibility from heavy rain
- Roads crossing washes flooding rapidly

**Stupid Motorist Law:**
Arizona can charge you for rescue costs if you drive into a flooded road and require rescue.

### Flash Floods

Desert flash floods are extremely dangerous:
- Water rises in minutes with no warning
- Dry washes become raging rivers
- Just 6 inches of water can sweep a car away
- "Turn Around, Don't Drown"
