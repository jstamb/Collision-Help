## Intersection Accident Claims

Intersection accidents account for nearly half of all traffic collisions. If you've been injured at a dangerous intersection, understanding how these claims work—and what makes them unique—can help you maximize your recovery.

> [!INFO] Intersection accidents often involve disputes about right-of-way, making witness statements and physical evidence especially important.

## Why Intersection Claims Are Different

### Multiple Conflict Points

Unlike highway accidents, intersections have:
- Vehicles traveling in multiple directions
- Pedestrians crossing
- Cyclists sharing the roadway
- Complex signal timing
- Turn movements creating conflicts

### Disputed Fault

Intersection accidents frequently involve:
- "He said/she said" about light colors
- Disagreements about who had right-of-way
- Questions about turn signals
- Debates over pedestrian positioning
- Confusion about lane assignments

## Types of Intersection Accident Claims

### T-Bone (Broadside) Collisions

**Common causes:**
- Red light running
- Failure to yield on left turns
- Stop sign violations
- Misjudging gaps in traffic

**Claim considerations:**
- Usually clear fault (one driver violated right-of-way)
- Severe injuries due to minimal side protection
- Potential for vehicle totaling
- Witness testimony crucial

### Rear-End at Intersections

**Common causes:**
- Following too closely approaching intersection
- Distraction causing failure to notice stopped traffic
- Unexpected stops for pedestrians
- Yellow light dilemma zone

**Claim considerations:**
- Presumption of rear-driver fault
- Potential for chain reactions
- Whiplash claims common
- Traffic camera evidence helpful

### Left-Turn Accidents

**Common causes:**
- Turning in front of oncoming traffic
- Misjudging oncoming vehicle speed
- Blocked view from large vehicles
- Unprotected left-turn phases

**Claim considerations:**
- Left-turner usually presumed at fault
- But oncoming speeding can shift fault
- Yellow light timing disputes
- Signal phase evidence important

### Pedestrian Intersection Accidents

**Common causes:**
- Right-turning vehicles not seeing pedestrians
- Pedestrians crossing against signal
- Inadequate crossing time
- Distracted drivers

**Claim considerations:**
- Serious injuries common
- Comparative fault may apply
- Crosswalk vs. non-crosswalk distinctions
- ADA compliance issues

## Evidence That Wins Intersection Claims

### Physical Evidence

| Evidence Type | What It Proves |
|---------------|----------------|
| Skid marks | Speed, braking attempts |
| Vehicle damage | Point of impact, severity |
| Debris field | Where collision occurred |
| Traffic signals | Timing, malfunction |
| Road markings | Lane positions, turns |

### Documentary Evidence

**Traffic camera footage:**
- Red light cameras
- DOT traffic cameras
- Nearby business security cameras
- Dashcam from any vehicle

> [!TIP] Act quickly to preserve camera footage. Many systems overwrite after 24-72 hours. Send preservation letters immediately.

**Accident reconstruction:**
For serious accidents:
- Speed calculations from physical evidence
- Sight line analysis
- Signal timing verification
- 3D modeling of the collision

### Witness Evidence

Witnesses can establish:
- Which vehicle had the green light
- Whether signal was running properly
- Speed of vehicles approaching
- Pedestrian behavior
- Turn signal usage

## The Dangerous Intersection Factor

### When the Intersection Itself Is the Problem

You may have additional claims if:
- The intersection has a history of accidents
- Design defects create hazardous conditions
- Signals malfunction or have inadequate timing
- Sight lines are blocked by vegetation or structures
- Road markings are confusing or faded

### Government Liability Claims

To pursue a claim against a government entity:

1. **Establish they knew** (or should have known) about the danger
2. **Show they failed** to take reasonable action
3. **Prove the defect** contributed to your accident
4. **File notice** within strict deadlines (often 30-180 days)

**Evidence that helps:**
- Prior accident reports at the location
- Citizen complaints about the intersection
- Engineering studies identifying problems
- Newspaper coverage of prior crashes
- Traffic commission meeting minutes

## Fault Determination at Intersections

### Automatic Presumptions

| Scenario | Presumed Fault |
|----------|----------------|
| Red light running | Light runner |
| Stop sign violation | Sign violator |
| Left turn vs. through | Left turner |
| Rear-end collision | Following driver |
| Backing collision | Backing driver |

### Factors That Shift Fault

Even with presumptions, fault can shift if:
- Other driver was speeding
- Signal was malfunctioning
- View was obstructed by negligent third party
- Pedestrian was outside crosswalk
- Other driver was impaired

### Comparative Fault

Most states reduce your recovery by your fault percentage:

**Example:** $100,000 damages, you're 20% at fault
- Pure comparative: You recover $80,000
- Modified comparative: You recover $80,000 (or $0 if over 50-51%)

## Special Intersection Claim Scenarios

### Traffic Signal Malfunction

If a malfunctioning signal contributed to your accident:
- Document the malfunction (photos, video)
- Report to DOT immediately
- Get witness statements about signal behavior
- Check for other malfunction reports
- Consider government liability claim

### Construction Zone Intersections

Added complexity when:
- Temporary signals were confusing
- Lane markings were unclear
- Workers directed traffic improperly
- Signage was inadequate

**Potential defendants:** City/state DOT, construction company, traffic control contractor

### Multiple Vehicle Intersections

When more than two vehicles are involved:
- Each collision may have different fault allocation
- Chain reaction causation must be established
- Multiple insurance companies involved
- Subrogation between insurers complicates settlement

## Maximizing Your Intersection Claim

### Immediate Steps

1. **Call 911** - Get police report documenting the scene
2. **Photograph everything** - Signals, damage, positions, injuries
3. **Get witness info** - Names, phones, what they saw
4. **Don't admit fault** - Even "I'm sorry" can be used against you
5. **Seek medical care** - Document injuries immediately

### Building Your Case

1. **Request traffic camera footage** immediately
2. **Obtain the police report** within days
3. **Request signal timing records** through FOIA
4. **Research intersection history** through DOT records
5. **Document your injuries** thoroughly

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Giving a recorded statement** to the other insurance before consulting counsel
- **Accepting early settlement** before knowing full extent of injuries
- **Missing notice deadlines** for government claims
- **Not preserving evidence** before it's destroyed
- **Underestimating injuries** because of adrenaline

## What to Expect: Settlement Timeline

### Typical Intersection Claim Timeline

| Stage | Timeframe |
|-------|-----------|
| Medical treatment | 2-12 months |
| Demand letter sent | After maximum improvement |
| Insurance response | 30-45 days |
| Negotiation | 1-3 months |
| Settlement or suit | 6-18 months total |

### Factors That Extend Timeline

- Disputed liability (who ran the light)
- Serious or ongoing injuries
- Government entity involvement
- Multiple defendants
- Litigation required
