## Hurricane Evacuation Accidents

Hurricane evacuations save lives, but they also create dangerous driving conditions. Millions of vehicles on the road, fatigue, stress, and deteriorating weather combine to cause thousands of accidents during each major evacuation.

> [!WARNING] More people die in hurricane evacuations than from hurricane direct impacts in many storms. Traffic accidents, heat exposure, and medical emergencies during evacuations claim significant lives.

## Why Evacuation Driving Is So Dangerous

### Traffic Congestion

Mass evacuations create severe congestion:
- Millions of vehicles on limited routes
- Travel times multiply 5-10x normal
- Stop-and-go traffic for hours
- Vehicles overheat, mechanical failures
- Driver fatigue from extended trips

### Driver Condition

Evacuees are often impaired by:
- Extreme stress and anxiety
- Sleep deprivation from preparations
- Dehydration and lack of food
- Unfamiliarity with evacuation routes
- Distraction from worried family members

### Environmental Hazards

Conditions worsen as the storm approaches:
- Outer bands bring rain and wind
- Visibility decreases
- Standing water on roads
- Debris begins accumulating
- Gas stations run out of fuel

### Mechanical Failures

The evacuation environment is hard on vehicles:
- Extended idling overheats engines
- Stop-and-go wears brakes
- Low fuel creates stranding
- Tire blowouts from road debris
- Battery drain from A/C and electronics

## Types of Evacuation Accidents

### Rear-End Collisions

The most common evacuation accident:
- Stop-and-go traffic creates conditions for rear-ending
- Fatigued drivers have slower reactions
- Distracted drivers don't notice traffic stopping
- Chain reactions involve multiple vehicles

### Multi-Vehicle Pileups

When conditions deteriorate:
- Rain reduces visibility and traction
- One accident triggers many more
- Emergency response delayed by traffic
- Catastrophic injuries possible

### Wrong-Way Accidents

Contraflow operations create confusion:
- Some highways run all lanes one direction
- Unfamiliar drivers make mistakes
- Signage may be inadequate
- Fatal head-on collisions occur

### Heat-Related Incidents

Vehicles become dangerous in gridlock:
- Elderly and children vulnerable
- Pets left in cars
- Medical conditions worsen
- A/C failures in stuck traffic

### Fuel-Related Stranding

Running out of gas creates hazards:
- Vehicles stop in travel lanes
- Creating new accident risks
- Occupants stranded in dangerous conditions
- May attempt unsafe roadside walking

## Fault in Evacuation Accidents

### Standard Rules Still Apply

Despite emergency conditions:
- Drivers must maintain safe following distance
- Must adjust speed for conditions
- Must remain alert and attentive
- Weather is not an excuse for negligence

### Comparative Fault Issues

Both drivers may share fault:
- Following too closely in congestion
- Not using headlights in rain
- Distracted driving (checking weather apps)
- Fatigue-impaired driving
- Aggressive maneuvers in traffic

### When Others May Be Liable

**Government entities:**
- Contraflow signage was inadequate
- Evacuation routes were poorly planned
- Traffic control failed
- Warning systems were insufficient

**Gas stations/businesses:**
- Failed to maintain safe premises
- Created hazards for desperate evacuees
- Price gouging caused dangerous decisions

**Other drivers:**
- Road rage incidents during stressful evacuation
- Intoxicated driving
- Reckless attempts to pass in congestion

## State-Specific Evacuation Laws

### Florida

Evacuation procedures:
- Governor issues evacuation orders by zone
- Contraflow activated on major highways
- All tolls suspended during evacuation
- Must yield to emergency vehicles

**Legal requirements:**
- Must follow evacuation orders (recommended, not criminally enforced)
- Cannot impede evacuation traffic
- Special protections for first responders

### Texas

Evacuation framework:
- County judges issue evacuation orders
- TxDOT manages contraflow operations
- Fuel supplies coordinated by state
- Evacuee assistance stations established

**Key laws:**
- Price gouging prohibited during disasters
- Fuel priorities for emergency vehicles
- Criminal penalties for looting evacuated areas

### Louisiana/Gulf States

Similar evacuation structures:
- Mandatory vs. voluntary evacuation zones
- Interstate contraflow procedures
- Shelters along evacuation routes
- Pet-friendly shelter requirements

### North Carolina/East Coast

Hurricane preparedness:
- Barrier island mandatory evacuations
- I-40, I-95 evacuation corridors
- Return restrictions after storms
- Flood zone evacuation requirements

## Safe Evacuation Driving

### Before You Leave

**Vehicle preparation:**
- Fill gas tank before evacuation order
- Check tire pressure and condition
- Top off all fluids
- Ensure A/C works
- Charge phones and portable batteries

**Route planning:**
- Know multiple evacuation routes
- Download offline maps
- Identify gas stations along route
- Know locations of rest stops and shelters
- Have contingency destinations

**Supplies to carry:**
- Water (1 gallon per person minimum)
- Non-perishable snacks
- Medications for 7+ days
- Phone chargers
- Cash (ATMs may not work)
- Important documents
- Blankets and pillows

### During the Evacuation

**Driving safely:**
- Maintain safe following distance despite crawling traffic
- Stay in your lane—don't weave
- Take breaks when safe—fatigue kills
- Keep headlights on even during day
- Monitor weather and traffic updates

**Managing stress:**
- Expect long delays—plan for them
- Bring entertainment for children
- Stay hydrated and fed
- Take turns driving if possible
- Don't let stress cause aggressive driving

> [!TIP] Leave early. The earlier you leave, the safer and shorter your evacuation will be. Don't wait for mandatory orders if you're in a vulnerable area.

### If Conditions Deteriorate

**When to stop:**
- Rain makes driving dangerous
- Wind exceeds safe limits (sustained 45+ mph)
- Visibility drops significantly
- You're too fatigued to continue

**Where to shelter:**
- Sturdy buildings (hotels, shelters)
- NOT in your vehicle
- NOT under overpasses
- Interior rooms away from windows

### Contraflow Driving

**Understanding contraflow:**
- All highway lanes run in evacuation direction
- Entry points are controlled
- No stopping or U-turns
- Different rules apply

**Contraflow safety:**
- Follow all signage carefully
- Don't exit except at designated points
- Maintain lane discipline
- Don't stop for anything non-emergency
- Stay alert—this is unfamiliar driving

## Insurance Considerations

### Coverage During Evacuations

**Collision coverage:**
- Covers accident damage during evacuation
- Standard fault rules apply
- Deductible still applies
- Claims may be delayed due to storm volume

**Comprehensive coverage:**
- Covers storm damage to parked vehicle
- Covers flooding if not driving through water
- Covers debris damage
- Covers wind damage

### After an Evacuation Accident

1. **Document everything** despite chaos
2. **Exchange information** with other drivers
3. **Call police** if possible (may be delayed)
4. **Take photos** of damage and conditions
5. **Contact insurance** as soon as feasible

### Special Considerations

**Rental vehicles:**
- Your insurance may cover rental damage
- Credit card coverage may apply
- Get rental company emergency number
- Document rental condition before evacuating

**Total loss:**
- Storm volume delays assessments
- Temporary transportation assistance
- Salvage values may be affected
- Gap insurance valuable in evacuations

## What to Do After an Evacuation Accident

### Immediate Safety

1. **Get off the roadway** if possible
2. **Activate hazards**
3. **Check for injuries**
4. **Call 911** (may have long wait)
5. **Don't block evacuation traffic**

### Documentation

Gather despite difficult conditions:
- Other driver information
- Photos of damage and scene
- Weather conditions
- Time and location
- Witness contacts

### Post-Storm Claims

- Insurance adjusters will be overwhelmed
- Document damage immediately
- Keep all receipts for expenses
- Be patient but persistent
- Consider public adjuster for major claims
