## Florida Rainy Season Driving Guide

Florida's rainy season—roughly June through September—transforms driving conditions dramatically. Afternoon thunderstorms, flash flooding, and reduced visibility create hazards that catch visitors and residents alike off guard.

> [!WARNING] Florida leads the nation in lightning deaths and has some of the highest rates of wet-weather crashes. The state averages over 100 rainy days annually, with most concentrated in summer months.

## Understanding Florida's Rainy Season

### When It Occurs

Florida's distinct wet season:
- **Peak months:** June, July, August, September
- **Typical pattern:** Clear mornings, afternoon storms
- **Timing:** Usually 3-6 PM daily
- **Duration:** 30 minutes to 2 hours per storm
- **Frequency:** Nearly daily during peak season

### Why Florida Storms Are Different

Florida thunderstorms are uniquely dangerous:
- Develop rapidly with little warning
- Produce intense rainfall (2-3 inches/hour)
- Include frequent lightning
- Create localized flash flooding
- Can include hail and microbursts

### Regional Patterns

| Region | Storm Pattern | Peak Time |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Southeast (Miami) | Sea breeze driven | 3-5 PM |
| Central (Orlando) | Collision of coastal breezes | 4-6 PM |
| Gulf Coast (Tampa) | Gulf-driven storms | 3-6 PM |
| Panhandle | Gulf/land interaction | 2-4 PM |
| Keys | Quick tropical showers | Variable |

## Hazards of Florida Rain Driving

### Sudden Visibility Loss

Florida storms reduce visibility instantly:
- Heavy rain can cut visibility to near zero
- Spray from other vehicles compounds the problem
- Windshield wipers can't keep up with intense rain
- Lightning flashes cause temporary blindness

### Hydroplaning Risk

Florida's roads are particularly prone:
- Flat terrain allows water to pool
- Oil buildup between rains makes first minutes worst
- Many roads have inadequate drainage
- Highway speeds increase hydroplaning risk

> [!TIP] The first 10 minutes of a Florida afternoon storm are often the most dangerous. Oil that accumulated on the road rises to the surface before washing away, creating extremely slick conditions.

### Flash Flooding

Low-lying Florida floods quickly:
- Roads can flood within minutes
- Standing water hides road defects
- "Turn around, don't drown" applies
- Just 6 inches of water can sweep away a vehicle

### Lightning Danger

Florida is the lightning capital of the US:
- Your car is relatively safe (rubber tires myth—it's the metal frame)
- Don't exit your vehicle during lightning
- Avoid touching metal surfaces
- Stay in car if stuck in flooding during lightning

## Fault in Florida Rainy Season Accidents

### Florida's Comparative Negligence

Florida uses a comparative negligence system:
- Each party's fault is assigned a percentage
- You can recover even if partially at fault
- Your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage
- As of 2023, you cannot recover if more than 50% at fault

### Weather Is Not an Excuse

Under Florida law:
- Drivers must adjust speed for conditions
- "It was raining hard" doesn't excuse negligence
- Following too closely remains fault
- Running red lights in rain is still running red lights

### Common Florida Rain Accident Scenarios

**I-4 corridor pileups:**
- Notorious for sudden slowdowns in rain
- Rear-end collisions are most common
- Following driver typically at fault
- Chain reactions assign fault to each impact

**Hydroplaning on US-1:**
- Flat, often flooded coastal highway
- Driver who hydroplanes usually at fault
- Tire condition may be factor
- Speed almost always too fast for conditions

**Miami urban flooding:**
- Low-lying streets flood rapidly
- Driving through flood damage is usually driver's fault
- "Didn't know it was that deep" isn't a defense
- Exceptions if flooding was unusually sudden

## Special Florida Considerations

### Tourist Drivers

Florida's tourist population creates unique issues:
- Unfamiliar with daily storm patterns
- May not know flood-prone areas
- Often drive rental cars (unfamiliar vehicles)
- May panic in sudden heavy rain

### Elderly Drivers

Florida's large elderly population:
- May have slower reaction times
- Vision issues compounded by rain
- Some avoid driving in rain entirely (creating traffic surges after storms)
- Higher injury severity in crashes

### Commercial Traffic

I-95 and I-75 carry heavy truck traffic:
- Large trucks create intense spray
- Stopping distances increase dramatically
- Lane changes by trucks in rain are dangerous
- Truck-involved rain crashes are often severe

## Insurance Considerations in Florida

### No-Fault State Rules

Florida is a no-fault state:
- Your PIP covers your injuries regardless of fault
- PIP required: $10,000 medical, $10,000 death benefit
- Bodily injury liability optional but recommended
- Can sue for serious injuries exceeding threshold

### Collision Coverage

For vehicle damage in rain accidents:
- Collision coverage pays for your car (minus deductible)
- Comprehensive covers flood damage (non-driving)
- Some policies exclude water damage—check yours
- Rental car coverage important during rainy season

### Uninsured Motorist Coverage

Critical in Florida:
- Florida has high uninsured driver rate (~20%)
- Rainy season may increase hit-and-run risk
- UM coverage protects you from uninsured at-fault drivers
- Highly recommended in Florida

## Safe Driving Tips for Florida Rain

### Before Rainy Season

**Vehicle preparation:**
- Check tire tread depth (penny test)
- Replace worn wiper blades
- Ensure all lights work
- Check defroster function
- Verify washer fluid is full

**Plan ahead:**
- Know flood-prone routes in your area
- Identify alternate routes
- Keep emergency supplies in car
- Download weather apps with alerts

### During Storms

**If caught in heavy rain:**
1. Slow down significantly
2. Turn on headlights (Florida law in rain)
3. Increase following distance to 5+ seconds
4. Avoid lane changes if possible
5. Use A/C to clear windshield fog

**If visibility is near zero:**
1. Pull completely off the road
2. Turn on hazard lights
3. Turn off headlights when stopped (confuses drivers)
4. Wait for the worst to pass
5. Don't stop on the travel lanes

### Handling Flooding

**Never drive through standing water:**
- You can't judge the depth
- The road may be washed out underneath
- Your car can stall and be swept away
- Contaminated water damages vehicles

**If water is rising around your car:**
1. Open window/door before water reaches electronics
2. Unbuckle seatbelt
3. Exit through window if door won't open
4. Get to higher ground immediately
5. Don't go back for possessions

## Florida-Specific Road Hazards

### I-4 (Tampa to Daytona)

Often called "the most dangerous highway in America":
- Combines commuter and tourist traffic
- Afternoon storms hit during rush hour
- Construction zones add confusion
- Rear-end collisions common in rain

### I-95 Coastal Corridor

Heavy traffic meets coastal storms:
- Sea-breeze storms hit suddenly
- High truck traffic creates spray
- Urban flooding in Miami-Dade
- Speed combined with rain is deadly

### Alligator Alley (I-75)

Crosses the Everglades:
- Standing water common
- Limited places to pull off
- Wildlife crossing in rain
- Cell service spotty for emergencies

### US-1 in the Keys

Unique challenges:
- Single road in and out
- Ocean spray combines with rain
- Bridge crossings exposed to wind
- Flooding can strand motorists

## What to Do After a Florida Rain Accident

### Immediate Steps

1. **Move to safety** if possible
2. **Turn on hazards**
3. **Call 911**—Florida requires reports for injuries or $500+ damage
4. **Document conditions** (rain intensity, standing water)
5. **Exchange information** with other drivers

### Evidence to Gather

- Photos of water on road
- Weather app screenshots showing storm
- Your tire condition
- Other driver's tire condition
- Road drainage or flooding issues

### Florida-Specific Requirements

- Must file crash report if police don't respond
- 14 days to seek PIP medical treatment
- Notice to government entities: 30 days for municipalities
- Statute of limitations: 2 years for negligence (as of 2023)
