## Rain Accidents: Who Is at Fault?

When accidents happen in rainy conditions, drivers often wonder if weather can excuse their actions. The short answer: almost never. Understanding how fault works in rain-related accidents can protect your claim.

> [!INFO] Weather is a contributing factor, not an excuse. Drivers are expected to adjust their behavior for conditions. If you cause an accident in the rain, you're likely at fault.

## The Legal Standard: Reasonable Care

### Duty to Adjust for Conditions

Every driver must exercise "reasonable care" under the circumstances. In rain, this means:
- Reducing speed below the posted limit
- Increasing following distance
- Using headlights for visibility
- Avoiding sudden maneuvers
- Being prepared for reduced traction

### "Too Fast for Conditions"

This phrase appears in countless accident reports:
- You can be speeding even below the speed limit
- Posted limits assume ideal conditions
- Rain reduces safe speeds significantly
- What's safe on dry pavement is often unsafe when wet

**Example:** Driving 45 mph in a 50 zone during heavy rain may be "too fast for conditions" if visibility is limited and roads are slick.

## Common Rain Accident Scenarios

### Rear-End Collisions

**What happens:**
The leading vehicle stops for traffic; the following vehicle can't stop in time due to wet roads.

**Fault determination:**
- Following driver is almost always at fault
- "I couldn't stop because of the rain" is not a defense
- Duty to maintain safe following distance for conditions
- Following distance should be 4+ seconds in rain (vs. 3 in dry)

### Hydroplaning Crashes

**What happens:**
A vehicle's tires lose contact with the road, causing loss of control and striking another vehicle or object.

**Fault determination:**
- The hydroplaning driver is typically at fault
- Drivers are expected to slow down in rain
- Hydroplaning is usually caused by excessive speed
- Worn tires increase risk (driver responsibility)

> [!WARNING] Hydroplaning can occur at speeds as low as 35 mph on wet roads with worn tires. Maintaining proper tire tread is your responsibility.

### Loss of Control on Curves

**What happens:**
A vehicle enters a curve too fast for wet conditions and crosses into oncoming traffic or runs off the road.

**Fault determination:**
- The driver who lost control is at fault
- "The road was slick" is not a defense
- Should have reduced speed before the curve
- May have additional liability if tires were worn

### Intersection Accidents in Rain

**What happens:**
Limited visibility, extended stopping distances, or slick roads contribute to intersection crashes.

**Fault determination:**
- Standard right-of-way rules still apply
- Running a red light is fault regardless of weather
- "I couldn't see the light" may shift fault to the driver
- Following too closely through intersections remains negligent

## When Other Parties May Share Fault

### Road Authority Liability

The government may share liability if:
- Drainage systems were inadequate, causing standing water
- Warning signs for slick areas were missing
- Road design created unreasonable water accumulation
- Known dangerous conditions weren't addressed

**Proving road authority fault:**
- Prior accidents at the same location
- Complaints about drainage issues
- Maintenance records showing neglect
- Design defects that cause water pooling

### Vehicle Defects

A manufacturer may share liability if:
- Tire defects caused premature wear or blowout
- Wiper system failed during rain
- ABS or traction control malfunctioned
- Windshield defrost didn't work properly

### Employer Liability

If a commercial driver causes a rain accident:
- Employer may be vicariously liable
- Did employer pressure driver to continue despite conditions?
- Were vehicles properly maintained (tires, wipers)?
- Were drivers trained for adverse conditions?

## How Insurance Companies Handle Rain Claims

### What Adjusters Consider

When evaluating rain accident claims:
- Weather conditions at time of accident
- Speed you were traveling
- Condition of your tires and vehicle
- Whether you had headlights on
- Your following distance
- Any evasive actions taken

### What They'll Look For

Evidence that shifts fault to you:
- Speed above what's reasonable for conditions
- Bald or worn tires
- Following too closely
- Failure to use headlights
- Distracted driving (phone use)
- Aggressive maneuvers

### Defending Your Claim

Evidence that protects you:
- Dashcam footage showing your careful driving
- Witness statements about the other driver's speed
- Police report noting other driver's fault
- Photos showing other vehicle's worn tires
- Weather service data about sudden conditions

## Comparative Fault in Rain Accidents

### How Fault Percentages Work

In most states, both drivers can share fault:

**Example:** Heavy rain accident at intersection
- Driver A ran a yellow-turning-red light
- Driver B was going too fast for conditions
- Result: A is 70% at fault, B is 30% at fault

**Recovery (in comparative negligence state):**
If Driver B has $50,000 in damages:
- 30% reduction for own fault
- Recovers $35,000 from Driver A's insurance

### Factors That Can Increase Your Fault Percentage

- Not using headlights in rain
- Worn wiper blades limiting visibility
- Speeding or not reducing speed
- Following too closely
- Bald or underinflated tires
- Making sudden lane changes

## Evidence in Rain Accident Claims

### Critical Evidence to Collect

**At the scene:**
- Photos of road conditions (standing water, spray)
- Photos of all vehicles' tires
- Weather app data showing rain intensity
- Witness statements about both drivers' behavior
- Police report with officer's observations

**After the accident:**
- Official weather data for exact time/location
- Your vehicle's maintenance records
- Dashcam footage if available
- 911 call recording mentioning conditions

### Weather Data Sources

- National Weather Service historical data
- Local weather station archives
- Weather app history on your phone
- News reports about storm conditions
- Airport weather observations (METAR)

## Safe Driving in Rain

### Reduce Your Risk

- Slow down significantly (10-15+ mph below limit)
- Increase following distance to 4+ seconds
- Use headlights even in light rain
- Avoid cruise control (less feel for traction)
- Stay in middle lanes (water pools in outer lanes)
- Avoid sudden braking or steering
- Replace wipers and check tires regularly

### If Conditions Worsen

- Pull over safely if you can't see
- Turn on hazards when stopped
- Wait for heavy rain to pass
- Don't drive through standing water of unknown depth

## Key Takeaways

- Rain is not an excuse—drivers must adjust to conditions
- "Too fast for conditions" means fault even below the speed limit
- Hydroplaning is almost always the driver's fault
- Worn tires and poor vehicle maintenance can increase your fault
- Road authorities can share liability for drainage failures
- Document weather conditions and both vehicles' tires after an accident
- Comparative fault means both parties can share responsibility
