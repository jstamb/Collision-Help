## Texas Flash Flood Accidents

Texas leads the nation in flash flood fatalities, and most of those deaths occur in vehicles. The state's unique geography, sudden storms, and expansive road network create deadly flooding conditions that claim lives every year.

> [!WARNING] Texas averages more flood deaths than any other state—typically 15-20 annually, with over half occurring in vehicles. "Turn around, don't drown" isn't just a slogan—it's a survival rule.

## Why Texas Floods Are So Deadly

### Geography Creates Risk

Texas terrain makes flash flooding severe:
- Hill Country has steep terrain and thin soil
- Water runs off quickly into low-water crossings
- Urban areas have extensive impervious surfaces
- Bayous and drainage channels overflow rapidly
- Flat coastal areas flood with nowhere for water to go

### Storm Characteristics

Texas thunderstorms are exceptional flood producers:
- Can drop 6+ inches of rain in an hour
- Often stationary, dumping rain on same area
- Occur year-round (no "safe" season)
- Can develop with little warning
- May produce flooding far from rainfall

### The Danger of Low-Water Crossings

Texas has thousands of low-water crossings:
- Designed to flood (cheaper than bridges)
- Water rises incredibly fast
- Often no warnings or barriers
- Familiar crossings catch locals off guard
- Just 6 inches of moving water can knock you down

> [!TIP] Low-water crossings that you've driven through hundreds of times can become death traps in minutes. Never assume a crossing is safe because it was safe before.

## Flash Flood Vehicle Dangers

### How Little Water It Takes

| Water Depth | Danger Level |
|-------------|--------------|
| 6 inches | Can knock person down, stall cars |
| 12 inches | Floats most passenger vehicles |
| 18 inches | Sweeps away SUVs and trucks |
| 24 inches | Carries away nearly all vehicles |

### Why Vehicles Fail in Floods

- Vehicles float at surprisingly shallow depths
- Tires lose traction on flooded surfaces
- Engines stall when water enters air intake
- Power locks and windows may fail
- Swift water pushes vehicles off road

### The Fatal Mistake

Most flood deaths happen when drivers:
1. Approach flooded road
2. Think "it doesn't look that deep"
3. Enter the water
4. Vehicle stalls or is swept away
5. Can't escape the vehicle

## Fault in Texas Flood Accidents

### Texas Negligence Law

Texas is a modified comparative fault state:
- If you're more than 50% at fault, you recover nothing
- Your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage
- Driving into known flood waters is typically your fault

### When Drivers Are at Fault

**Almost always fault:**
- Driving around "Road Closed" barricades
- Entering visible standing water
- Crossing flooded low-water crossing
- Ignoring warnings on navigation apps
- "I didn't think it was that deep"

**May share fault:**
- Sudden flooding with no warning
- Barricades not yet deployed
- First flash of flood with no time to react

### When Others May Be Liable

**Government liability (limited):**
- Failed to maintain drainage systems
- Didn't deploy barricades in time
- Known flooding problem wasn't addressed
- Warning systems malfunctioned

**Texas has strong sovereign immunity:**
- Government claims are difficult
- Must prove actual notice of specific defect
- Strict notice requirements (often 6 months)
- Caps on damages against government

### Rescue and Recovery

If you drive into flood water and need rescue:
- Texas jurisdictions may bill you for rescue costs
- Some counties have passed "stupid motorist" laws
- Rescue costs can be thousands of dollars
- Your insurance probably doesn't cover rescue fees

## High-Risk Areas in Texas

### Hill Country

Most dangerous region for flash floods:
- Steep terrain accelerates water flow
- Thin soil provides little absorption
- Numerous low-water crossings
- Popular tourist area with unfamiliar drivers
- Rivers rise extremely quickly

**Highest risk areas:**
- Blanco, Guadalupe, Comal river crossings
- Roads along Barton Creek
- FM roads throughout Hill Country
- Highway 281 north of San Antonio

### Houston/Gulf Coast

Urban flooding at its worst:
- Flat terrain slows drainage
- Extensive impervious surfaces
- Bayous overflow into streets
- Infrastructure overwhelmed by heavy rain
- Flood water may be contaminated

**Dangerous roads:**
- I-10 and I-45 underpasses
- Buffalo Bayou area streets
- Brays Bayou corridor
- Addicks and Barker Reservoir areas
- Hobby Airport vicinity

### Dallas-Fort Worth

Urban flash flood risk:
- Trinity River flood zones
- Numerous creeks overflow quickly
- Highway underpasses trap water
- Urban development increases runoff

### Austin

Combination of Hill Country and urban:
- Barton Creek flooding
- Waller Creek through downtown
- Bull Creek crossings
- Onion Creek (catastrophic flooding history)
- Shoal Creek through central Austin

## Safe Driving During Texas Storms

### Before You Drive

- Check weather radar (Texas storms move fast)
- Know flood-prone roads on your route
- Have alternate routes planned
- Keep phone charged for alerts
- Consider delaying travel

### During Heavy Rain

**Reduce speed:**
- Posted limits assume dry conditions
- Heavy rain requires 10-20 mph reduction
- Hydroplaning risk increases with speed

**Watch for flooding:**
- Standing water can hide depth
- Road edges flood first
- Underpasses collect water
- Low-water crossings fill rapidly

### When You Encounter Flooded Roads

**Do not enter the water.**

Instead:
1. Stop before the water
2. Turn around and find alternate route
3. If water is rising around you, get to higher ground
4. Call 911 if stranded or see others in danger

### "Turn Around, Don't Drown"

This Texas-born phrase saves lives:
- You cannot judge water depth from your car
- Road may be washed out under water
- Water may be moving faster than it looks
- Just 6 inches can sweep you away
- The "other side" isn't worth your life

## If Your Vehicle Stalls in Water

### Act Immediately

1. **Unbuckle seatbelt**
2. **Open window or door** (before electronics fail)
3. **Get out immediately**—don't wait
4. **Get to higher ground**
5. **Don't go back** for possessions

### If Water Is Rising Around You

- Exit through window (doors may not open against pressure)
- If trapped, break window (escape tool, headrest posts)
- Swim/walk to highest ground
- Grab something floating if needed
- Call 911 only if you can do so safely

### Special Considerations

**Children:**
- Unbuckle them before yourself
- Carry small children on your back
- Keep older children holding onto you
- Practice water escape in advance

**Night flooding:**
- Extremely dangerous—can't see water
- Rely on navigation warnings
- If road looks wet, stop and assess
- Don't drive into unknown conditions

## Insurance for Flood Damage

### Comprehensive Coverage

Covers flood damage to your vehicle:
- Required for any flood claim
- Has a deductible

- Does NOT cover driving into known flood

### Flood Exclusions

Your claim may be denied if:
- You drove into visible flood water
- You ignored barricades
- Damage was from "intentional" action
- You drove into water despite warnings

### Documenting Flood Damage

- Photograph water lines on vehicle
- Document where vehicle was found
- Get weather service data for location
- Note any warnings you did/didn't receive
- Save navigation app screenshots
