## Can You Keep Your Car After Insurance Totals It?

Yes, in most states you can keep your totaled vehicle. This is called **owner-retained salvage** or **buying back** your totaled car. However, there are important financial and practical considerations before making this decision.

> [!INFO] When you keep a totaled car, the insurance company deducts the salvage value from your settlement, and your vehicle receives a salvage or rebuilt title.

## How Owner-Retained Salvage Works

When you choose to keep your totaled car, here's what happens:

1. **Insurance calculates the salvage value** - What they'd get selling it to a salvage yard
2. **Salvage value is deducted from your settlement** - You receive ACV minus salvage
3. **Title is branded** - Your clean title becomes a salvage title
4. **You take possession** - The car stays with you to repair or sell

### Example Calculation

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Actual Cash Value (ACV) | $15,000 |
| Less: Salvage Value | -$3,500 |
| **Your Settlement** | **$11,500** |

You keep the car AND receive $11,500.

## When Keeping Your Totaled Car Makes Sense

Owner-retained salvage is a good choice when:

- **Damage is mostly cosmetic** - Dents, scratches, but mechanically sound
- **Repair costs are manageable** - You can fix it cheaper than salvage deduction
- **You're handy with repairs** - DIY skills reduce costs significantly
- **It's your only transportation** - You need wheels while sorting things out
- **Sentimental value** - Classic car, family vehicle, or rare model
- **You want to part it out** - Valuable components you can sell

> [!TIP] If the salvage deduction is $4,000 but you can repair the car for $2,500, you're $1,500 ahead by keeping it.

## When You Should NOT Keep It

Let the insurance company take the car when:

- **Frame or structural damage** - Safety risk and expensive to fix properly
- **Airbags deployed** - Replacement costs $1,000-5,000+ per airbag
- **Flood damage** - Hidden electrical and mechanical problems
- **Repair costs exceed salvage value** - You'd lose money
- **You can't afford repairs** - A broken car in your driveway helps no one
- **Your state restricts rebuilt titles** - Some states make it very difficult

> [!WARNING] Frame damage is often underestimated. Even "repaired" frame damage affects safety, alignment, and resale value permanently.

## The Salvage Title Process

Once you keep a totaled car, the title process begins:

### Step 1: Receive Salvage Title

Your state DMV issues a **salvage title** or **certificate of destruction**, depending on damage severity. This document shows the car was declared a total loss.

### Step 2: Complete Repairs

You're responsible for all repairs. Keep every receipt and document all work done. You'll need this documentation later.

### Step 3: Pass Salvage Inspection

Most states require a **salvage vehicle inspection** before you can register the car:

- Verify VIN matches documentation
- Confirm stolen parts weren't used
- Check that repairs meet safety standards
- Review receipts for major components

### Step 4: Obtain Rebuilt Title

After passing inspection, you receive a **rebuilt title** (also called "reconstructed" in some states). This allows you to:

- Register the vehicle
- Drive it legally
- Obtain insurance
- Sell it (with disclosure)

## State-by-State Variations

Title branding and inspection requirements vary significantly:

| State Category | Requirements |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Strict states** | Multiple inspections, extensive documentation, photos required |
| **Moderate states** | Single inspection, basic documentation |
| **Lenient states** | Minimal inspection, self-certification allowed |

> [!INFO] Check your specific state's DMV website for exact requirements. Some states like California have very strict rebuilt title processes.

## Insurance After a Rebuilt Title

Getting insurance on a rebuilt title vehicle is possible but different:

### What to Expect

- **Liability coverage** - Usually available at normal rates
- **Collision coverage** - Often available but may be limited
- **Comprehensive coverage** - May be restricted or unavailable
- **Higher scrutiny** - Insurers may require inspection photos
- **Limited payouts** - Claims may be reduced 20-40% due to title brand

### Tips for Insuring Rebuilt Title Vehicles

1. Shop multiple insurers - policies vary widely
2. Document the quality of repairs with photos
3. Get professional inspection documentation
4. Ask specifically about rebuilt title coverage
5. Consider specialty insurers like Hagerty for classics

## Resale Value Impact

A rebuilt title significantly affects future value:

- **Typical reduction**: 20-40% below clean-title value
- **Buyer pool shrinks**: Many buyers avoid rebuilt titles
- **Dealer trade-in**: Most dealers offer wholesale (low) prices
- **Private sale**: Best option but requires disclosure
- **Financing difficulty**: Many lenders won't finance rebuilt titles

### Disclosure Requirements

In all states, you must disclose the rebuilt title status when selling. Failure to disclose can result in:

- Rescission of sale
- Fraud charges
- Civil liability for damages

## Making the Decision: Keep or Surrender?

### Calculate Your Break-Even Point

| If You Keep the Car | If You Surrender |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Settlement: $11,500 | Settlement: $15,000 |
| Repair costs: -$3,000 | You owe on a car you don't have |
| Future value: ~$9,000 | Must buy replacement |
| **Net position**: $17,500 in value | **Net position**: $15,000 cash |

### Questions to Ask Yourself

1. Can I afford the repairs right now?
2. Do I have the skills or trusted mechanic?
3. Is the damage truly repairable safely?
4. How long do I plan to keep this car?
5. Can I handle a rebuilt title on my record?

## Step-by-Step: How to Keep Your Totaled Car

1. **Tell your adjuster** you want to retain the salvage
2. **Get the salvage deduction in writing** before agreeing
3. **Negotiate the deduction** if it seems high
4. **Accept the net settlement** (ACV minus salvage)
5. **Receive the salvage title** from your state
6. **Complete repairs** and document everything
7. **Schedule salvage inspection** with your state
8. **Obtain rebuilt title** after passing inspection
9. **Get new insurance** with rebuilt title coverage
