## What is a Total Loss Threshold?

A total loss threshold is the percentage of your car's value at which insurance companies must declare it a total loss. Once repair costs hit this threshold, your car is "totaled" regardless of whether it could technically be fixed.

> [!INFO] Understanding your state's threshold helps you predict whether your damaged car will be totaled and prepare accordingly.

## How States Determine Total Loss

States use one of two methods:

### 1. Percentage Threshold

Most states set a specific percentage. If repair costs equal or exceed this percentage of your car's actual cash value (ACV), it's totaled.

**Example**: In a 75% threshold state, if your car is worth $20,000 and repairs cost $15,000 (75%), it's a total loss.

### 2. Total Loss Formula (TLF)

Some states use a formula instead:

**Repair Cost + Salvage Value > ACV = Total Loss**

This means your car can be totaled at lower repair percentages if the salvage value is high.

**Example**: Car worth $20,000, repairs $8,000, salvage value $14,000.
$8,000 + $14,000 = $22,000 > $20,000 = Total Loss (even though repairs were only 40% of ACV)

### States Using Total Loss Formula (TLF)

| State | Method |
|-------|--------|
| Alabama | TLF as alternative |
| Alaska | TLF only |
| Arizona | TLF only |
| California | TLF only |
| District of Columbia | TLF only |
| Kansas | TLF as alternative |
| New York | TLF only |
| Texas | TLF only |

> [!WARNING] Thresholds change periodically. Always verify current requirements with your state's insurance department.

## States with the Lowest Thresholds

If you live in these states, your car is more likely to be totaled:

1. **Iowa** - 50%
2. **Oklahoma** - 60%
3. **Nevada** - 65%
4. **Indiana** - 70%
5. **Minnesota** - 70%
6. **Wisconsin** - 70%

### What Low Thresholds Mean for You

- Cars are totaled more easily
- Older vehicles more frequently totaled
- May receive settlement for repairable damage
- Rebuilt title process needed if you want to keep car

## States with the Highest Thresholds

These states require more damage before declaring total loss:

1. **Colorado** - 100%
2. **Texas** - TLF (often exceeds 100%)
3. **Oregon** - 80%
4. **Missouri** - 80%
5. **Montana** - 80%

### What High Thresholds Mean for You

- More likely to get repairs instead of settlement
- Extensive damage needed for total loss
- May end up with a repaired car you'd prefer totaled
- Less flexibility in keeping salvage

## States with No Set Threshold

Three states leave total loss determination to insurers:

- **New Jersey**
- **Ohio**
- **Pennsylvania**

In these states, insurance companies set their own thresholds (typically 70-80%). Your policy documents may specify the threshold used.

> [!TIP] In states without set thresholds, you may have more room to negotiate whether your car is totaled or repaired.

## How This Affects Your Claim

### Near the Threshold

If your damage is close to your state's threshold:

- **Just under**: Insurer may try to repair
- **Just over**: Car will be totaled
- **Gray area**: Room for negotiation

### Strategies Based on Threshold

**If you WANT your car totaled:**
- Document all damage thoroughly
- Point out hidden damage possibilities
- Get repair estimates from expensive shops
- Mention safety concerns

**If you want your car REPAIRED:**
- Suggest cheaper repair alternatives
- Offer to waive cosmetic repairs
- Highlight the car's condition before accident
- Point out that repair keeps you as customer

## The "Constructive Total Loss" Exception

Even in high-threshold states, insurers can declare a "constructive total loss" when:

- Parts are unavailable at any price
- Repair time would be unreasonable (months)
- Safety cannot be assured after repair
- Vehicle is too old to warrant repair investment

## Impact on Your Settlement

Your state's threshold affects your potential payout:

| Threshold | Repair Cost | ACV | Outcome |
|-----------|-------------|-----|---------|
| 75% | $12,000 | $15,000 | Totaled - receive ~$15,000 |
| 75% | $10,000 | $15,000 | Repaired - no settlement |
| 100% | $14,000 | $15,000 | Repaired - no settlement |
| 100% | $16,000 | $15,000 | Totaled - receive ~$15,000 |

> [!INFO] When totaled, you typically receive the full ACV minus any deductible. When repaired, you pay your deductible and insurance covers repairs.

## What to Do After Learning Your State's Threshold

1. **Calculate the math** - Compare repair estimate to (ACV × threshold)
2. **Anticipate the outcome** - Know if you'll likely be totaled
3. **Prepare documentation** - Gather comparable values if totaling seems likely
4. **Consider preferences** - Do you want the car repaired or totaled?
5. **Negotiate strategically** - Use threshold knowledge to guide discussions

## Special Circumstances

### Leased Vehicles

Leasing companies may have different total loss thresholds written into your lease agreement, potentially lower than state requirements.

### Financed Vehicles

Lenders don't set thresholds, but if your car is totaled and you owe more than ACV, you'll need GAP insurance to cover the difference.

### Classic and Collector Cars

Agreed-value policies may use different total loss calculations. Review your specialty policy terms.
