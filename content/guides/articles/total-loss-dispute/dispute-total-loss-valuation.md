## Why You Should Dispute a Low Valuation

Insurance companies are businesses focused on minimizing payouts. Their initial total loss offer is rarely their best offer. Studies show that first settlement offers are typically 10-20% below fair market value.

> [!INFO] You have the legal right to dispute any total loss valuation. Insurance companies expect negotiation and often have room to increase their offer.

## Step 1: Get the Complete Valuation Report

Before you can dispute the valuation, you need to understand how they arrived at their number.

**Request these documents from your adjuster:**

- The full valuation report (not just the summary)
- List of comparable vehicles used
- Condition assessment details
- Any deductions applied and why
- The valuation service used (CCC, Mitchell, Audatex)

### What to Look For in the Report

Common issues that lower your payout unfairly:

- **Wrong trim level** - Base model instead of your loaded version
- **Missing options** - Navigation, sunroof, leather seats not included
- **Incorrect mileage** - Higher miles than your car actually has
- **Unfair condition ratings** - "Fair" when your car was "Good" or "Excellent"
- **Geographic errors** - Comparables from cheaper markets

## Step 2: Research Comparable Vehicles

Your strongest negotiating tool is evidence of what similar vehicles actually sell for.

**Where to find comparables:**

1. **Online marketplaces**
   - Autotrader.com
   - Cars.com
   - CarGurus.com
   - Facebook Marketplace

2. **Dealer listings**
   - Local dealership websites
   - Certified pre-owned programs

3. **Valuation tools**
   - Kelley Blue Book (kbb.com)
   - NADA Guides (nadaguides.com)
   - Edmunds.com

> [!TIP] Search for vehicles within 100 miles of your zip code with similar mileage (within 10,000 miles), same year, same trim level, and similar condition.

### Document Everything

For each comparable you find:
- Screenshot the listing
- Note the asking price
- Record the mileage and options
- Save the date you found it
- Include the VIN if visible

## Step 3: Document Your Vehicle's Condition

Prove your car was worth more than their assessment suggests.

**Gather this evidence:**

- Recent maintenance records
- Receipts for new tires, brakes, batteries
- Photos showing excellent condition
- Documentation of upgrades or accessories
- Carfax or AutoCheck history report
- Any professional detailing receipts

### Create a Written Summary

List every feature and upgrade your car had:
- Factory options (leather, navigation, premium audio)
- Aftermarket additions (remote start, bed liner, roof rack)
- Recent repairs or replacements
- Any special packages or editions

## Step 4: Calculate Your Counter-Offer

Add up the evidence to determine a fair value.

**Your counter-offer should include:**

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Average of comparable listings | $XX,XXX |
| Add: Recent improvements/repairs | $XXX |
| Add: Low mileage adjustment | $XXX |
| Add: Superior condition adjustment | $XXX |
| **Your Counter-Offer** | **$XX,XXX** |

> [!WARNING] Be realistic. Asking for double the offer will get you dismissed. A 15-25% increase backed by solid evidence is reasonable.

## Step 5: Submit Your Dispute in Writing

A formal written dispute is more effective than phone calls alone.

**Your dispute letter should include:**

1. Your claim number and policy number
2. Date of loss and vehicle information
3. Their offer amount and your counter-offer
4. Point-by-point explanation of why their valuation is wrong
5. All supporting documentation (comparables, receipts, photos)
6. A specific dollar amount you're requesting
7. A reasonable deadline for response (10-14 days)

### Sample Dispute Language

> "I am disputing the total loss valuation of $12,500 for my 2019 Honda Accord EX-L. Based on my research of comparable vehicles in the local market, the fair market value is $15,200. I have attached 6 comparable listings averaging $15,450, along with documentation of recent maintenance totaling $1,200 and photos demonstrating excellent condition."

## Step 6: Request an Independent Appraisal

If negotiations stall, most policies include an appraisal clause.

**How the appraisal process works:**

1. You hire an independent appraiser (typically $150-400)
2. The insurance company hires their appraiser
3. Both appraisers attempt to agree on value
4. If they can't agree, they select an umpire
5. Any two of the three agreeing sets the binding value

> [!TIP] The appraisal clause is often your best option when the gap between your value and theirs is significant ($2,000+).

## Step 7: File a Complaint if Necessary

If the insurance company refuses to negotiate in good faith:

**State Department of Insurance**
- File a formal complaint with your state's insurance regulator
- Complaints often prompt insurers to reconsider
- Most states have online complaint portals

**Small Claims Court**
- For disputes within your state's limit (usually $5,000-$10,000)
- No attorney needed
- File in the county where the accident occurred or where you live

## Timeline for Disputes

| Stage | Typical Timeline |
|-------|------------------|
| Initial review of their offer | 1-2 days |
| Research comparables | 3-5 days |
| Submit written dispute | 1 day |
| Insurance response | 7-14 days |
| Negotiation | 1-2 weeks |
| Appraisal process (if needed) | 2-4 weeks |

## What NOT to Do

Avoid these common mistakes:

- **Don't accept immediately** - You can always accept later
- **Don't sign a release** until you agree on the amount
- **Don't provide a recorded statement** without preparation
- **Don't threaten lawsuits** unless you're prepared to follow through
- **Don't get emotional** - Stick to facts and documentation
