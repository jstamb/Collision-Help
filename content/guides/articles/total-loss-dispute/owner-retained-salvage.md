## What is Owner Retained Salvage?

Owner retained salvage means keeping your totaled vehicle after the insurance company declares it a total loss. Instead of surrendering your car to the insurer, you keep possession and receive a reduced settlement - the actual cash value (ACV) minus the estimated salvage value.

> [!INFO] Owner retained salvage lets you keep your totaled car, repair it yourself, and potentially come out ahead financially - but it comes with permanent title consequences.

## How the Settlement Changes

When you retain salvage, your payout is calculated differently:

### Standard Total Loss Settlement
| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Actual Cash Value | $18,000 |
| Less: Deductible | -$500 |
| **You Receive** | **$17,500** |
| Car goes to: Insurance company |

### Owner Retained Salvage Settlement
| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Actual Cash Value | $18,000 |
| Less: Salvage Value | -$4,000 |
| Less: Deductible | -$500 |
| **You Receive** | **$13,500** |
| Car goes to: You |

The difference is the salvage deduction - what the insurance company would have received selling your car to a salvage yard or auction.

## How Salvage Value is Determined

Insurance companies calculate salvage value using:

- **Auction data** - What similar vehicles sell for at salvage auctions
- **Vehicle condition** - Running vs. non-running
- **Damage type** - Mechanical vs. cosmetic vs. structural
- **Parts value** - Demand for components from this model
- **Metal scrap value** - Base value if car is unsalvageable
- **Geographic location** - Salvage prices vary by region

### Typical Salvage Value Ranges

| Vehicle Condition | Salvage Value as % of ACV |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Running, cosmetic damage | 25-35% |
| Running, moderate damage | 20-30% |
| Non-running, repairable | 15-25% |
| Non-running, severe damage | 10-20% |
| Flood or fire damage | 5-15% |

## When Owner Retained Salvage Makes Sense

Consider keeping your totaled car if:

### The Math Works

- Repair cost is less than salvage deduction
- You can do repairs yourself (labor is the big cost)
- Parts are available and affordable
- You'll keep the car long-term

**Example:**
- Salvage deduction: $4,000
- Your repair cost: $2,500
- Net benefit: $1,500 ahead

### The Damage is Right

- **Cosmetic damage** - Dents, scratches, bumper damage
- **Minor mechanical** - Easy-to-replace components
- **Repairable panels** - Can be straightened vs. replaced
- **No airbag deployment** - Airbag replacement is expensive

### You Have Resources

- Access to tools and workspace
- Mechanical skills or trusted cheap labor
- Time to complete repairs
- Storage while repairs happen

## When to Surrender the Salvage

Let the insurance company take the car when:

- **Frame damage** - Structural integrity compromised
- **Multiple airbag deployment** - $2,000-8,000 to replace
- **Flood damage** - Hidden problems for years
- **Fire damage** - Wiring and components affected
- **Repair cost exceeds salvage deduction**
- **You can't store it** during repair process
- **You need cash now** for replacement vehicle

> [!WARNING] Frame damage is almost never worth repairing. Even "repaired" frames have alignment issues, reduced crash protection, and stigma that kills resale value.

## The Title Branding Process

When you keep a totaled vehicle, your title goes through changes:

### Stage 1: Salvage Title

Immediately upon total loss:
- Insurance company reports to DMV
- Your clean title becomes a **salvage title**
- Vehicle cannot be legally registered or driven
- Must display "SALVAGE" on title document

### Stage 2: Repairs

While holding salvage title:
- Complete all necessary repairs
- Keep receipts for all parts purchased
- Document work with photos
- Ensure all safety systems function

### Stage 3: Salvage Inspection

Before re-registration:
- Schedule inspection with state (DMV, highway patrol, or authorized shop)
- Inspector verifies VIN matches documentation
- Checks that no stolen parts were used
- Confirms vehicle meets safety standards
- Reviews repair receipts

### Stage 4: Rebuilt Title

After passing inspection:
- Salvage title converts to **rebuilt title**
- Some states call it "reconstructed" or "prior salvage"
- Vehicle can now be registered and driven legally
- Title permanently shows branded history

> [!TIP] Save EVERY receipt from repairs. States often require proof that parts came from legitimate sources, not stolen vehicles.

## State Requirements Vary

Each state has different rebuilt title processes:

| Requirement | Strict States | Lenient States |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Inspection type | Multiple inspections | Single inspection |
| Documentation | Extensive receipts | Basic documentation |
| Photos required | Before and after | Sometimes none |
| Wait periods | Yes, sometimes months | Usually none |
| Fee amount | $50-200+ | $25-75 |

**Examples of Strict States:** California, Georgia, New York
**Examples of Lenient States:** Alabama, Maine, Vermont

## Negotiating the Salvage Deduction

The salvage value isn't set in stone. You can negotiate:

### Request Salvage Bids

Ask your insurer for actual salvage bids:
- "What auction quotes did you receive?"
- "Can you provide documentation of salvage value?"
- "I'd like to see comparable salvage sales."

### Challenge High Deductions

If the salvage deduction seems excessive:
- Get your own salvage yard quotes
- Point out damage that reduces salvage value
- Document non-running status if applicable

### Timing Matters

Salvage values fluctuate:
- Popular models have higher salvage
- Newer vehicles worth more in parts
- Economic conditions affect scrap metal prices

## Insurance After Rebuilt Title

Getting insurance on a rebuilt title vehicle:

### What's Available

- **Liability** - Usually available at normal rates
- **Collision** - Often available but scrutinized
- **Comprehensive** - May be limited or excluded
- **Gap insurance** - Rarely available

### Challenges You'll Face

- Some insurers won't cover rebuilt titles at all
- Coverage may be limited (actual cash value reduced 20-40%)
- May require inspection photos before coverage
- Premiums might be higher

### Where to Shop

Insurers that commonly cover rebuilt titles:
- State Farm
- Progressive
- GEICO
- Farmers
- Regional insurers
- Specialty insurers

> [!INFO] Always disclose the rebuilt title status. Failure to disclose can result in claim denial or policy cancellation.

## Financial Analysis: Keep vs. Surrender

### Calculate Your Decision

| Factor | Keep Salvage | Surrender |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Cash received | ACV - Salvage - Deductible | ACV - Deductible |
| Repair cost | Your expense | $0 |
| Final vehicle value | Rebuilt title value | None |
| Time investment | Significant | None |
| Risk | Repair complications | Need new car |

### Break-Even Example

**Scenario:** 2018 Honda Accord, ACV $18,000

| Keep Salvage | Amount |
|--------------|--------|
| Settlement received | $13,500 |
| Repair cost | -$3,500 |
| Cash remaining | $10,000 |
| Rebuilt car value | +$12,600 |
| **Total position** | **$22,600** |

| Surrender Salvage | Amount |
|-------------------|--------|
| Settlement received | $17,500 |
| Car | None |
| **Total position** | **$17,500** |

In this example, keeping salvage puts you $5,100 ahead - if repairs go as planned.
