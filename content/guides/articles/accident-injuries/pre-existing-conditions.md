## Pre-Existing Conditions and Your Accident Claim

Having a pre-existing medical condition doesn't prevent you from recovering damages when a car accident aggravates or worsens that condition. The "eggshell plaintiff" rule protects injury victims, but you need to understand how to handle this issue in your claim.

> [!INFO] The law requires tortfeasors to "take their victims as they find them." If you had a pre-existing condition that made you more susceptible to injury, the at-fault driver is still responsible for the harm they caused.

## The Eggshell Plaintiff Rule

### What It Means

This legal doctrine states:
- Defendants must take plaintiffs as they find them
- If you're more vulnerable to injury, that's their problem
- They're liable for all harm they cause
- Even if a "normal" person wouldn't be hurt as badly

### How It Applies

Example scenarios:
- Prior back injury made worse by accident
- Arthritis in neck worsened by whiplash
- Previous knee surgery re-injured
- Old fracture site refractured
- Dormant condition activated

### Practical Application

What you can recover:
- Treatment to return to pre-accident state
- Treatment for aggravation
- Extended recovery time
- Permanent worsening
- New symptoms from old condition

## Common Pre-Existing Conditions

### Musculoskeletal

Frequently affected:
- Prior back injuries
- Neck problems (degenerative disc disease)
- Arthritis
- Previous fractures
- Shoulder/knee issues

### Neurological

May be affected:
- Prior concussions
- Migraine history
- Neuropathy
- Seizure disorders

### Psychological

Can be worsened:
- Anxiety
- Depression
- PTSD from prior trauma
- Chronic pain conditions

### Other Conditions

Also relevant:
- Fibromyalgia
- Chronic fatigue syndrome
- Autoimmune conditions
- Cardiovascular issues

> [!TIP] Don't hide your pre-existing conditions. Insurance will find out, and concealment destroys credibility. Instead, honestly document your pre-accident baseline and show how the accident made things worse.

## What You Must Prove

### Aggravation vs. Causation

Two approaches:

**Aggravation:**
- Had condition before
- Accident made it worse
- Entitled to recovery for worsening

**Lighting Up:**
- Had dormant/asymptomatic condition
- Accident activated it
- Entitled to recovery for activation

### Evidence Needed

To prove aggravation:
- Pre-accident medical records (baseline)
- Post-accident medical records (worsened)
- Comparison of symptoms/function
- Medical opinion on causation

## Documenting Your Baseline

### Pre-Accident Status

Establish your condition before:
- Treatment you were receiving
- Medications you were taking
- Symptoms you were experiencing
- Functional level
- Work capacity
- Activity level

### Why Baseline Matters

Shows the difference:
- "Before" vs. "After"
- What's attributable to accident
- How much worse it got
- What's new since accident

### Gathering Evidence

Collect:
- Prior medical records
- Previous imaging studies
- Past treatment records
- Employment records
- Activity evidence (photos, gym records)

## How Insurance Fights Pre-Existing Claims

### Common Tactics

**"It's all pre-existing"**
- Claim symptoms are from old condition
- Deny accident caused anything new
- Attribute everything to prior problems

**"Degenerative condition"**
- Claim MRI shows age-related changes
- Would have happened anyway
- Not from accident

**"Prior treatment proves it"**
- You were already in treatment
- Nothing new
- Just continuing old problems

**"You didn't disclose"**
- You hid your history
- Not credible
- Implies fraud

### Independent Medical Exam (IME)

Insurance will likely:
- Request IME
- Their doctor examines you
- Doctor often minimizes aggravation
- Attributes problems to pre-existing

> [!WARNING] Insurance company IME doctors frequently attribute symptoms to pre-existing conditions rather than the accident. Don't be surprised if their report is unfavorable - your treating physician's opinion matters too.

## Countering Insurance Defenses

### Medical Expert Support

Your doctor should:
- Acknowledge pre-existing condition
- Explain how accident worsened it
- Document the difference
- Opine on causation

### Before/After Comparison

Show the contrast:
- Pre-accident function level
- Post-accident function level
- Change in symptoms
- Change in treatment needs

### Lay Witness Testimony

Others can describe:
- How you functioned before
- Changes since accident
- Daily life differences
- Observable symptoms

## Medical Evidence Strategies

### Treating Physician Statement

Have doctor address:
- Pre-accident baseline
- How accident affected condition
- Need for additional treatment
- Prognosis now vs. before

### Causation Language

Medical records should state:
- "Aggravated by motor vehicle accident"
- "Symptoms worsened following accident"
- "Acceleration of degenerative condition"
- Clear causal connection

### Imaging Comparisons

If available:
- Pre-accident imaging
- Post-accident imaging
- Changes shown
- Expert interpretation

## Valuation Considerations

### Apportionment

Claims may be valued by:
- What's attributed to accident
- What's attributed to pre-existing
- Proportional recovery

### Full Recovery Arguments

Arguments for full recovery:
- Eggshell plaintiff rule
- Took you as they found you
- All worsening compensable

### Factors Affecting Value

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Documented stable baseline | Increases value |
| Clear aggravation | Increases value |
| Extensive prior treatment | May reduce value |
| Prior claims for same condition | May reduce credibility |
| Long symptom-free period | Increases value |

## Deposition/Testimony Preparation

### What to Expect

Questions about:
- Complete medical history
- Prior accidents/injuries
- Previous treatment
- Pre-accident symptoms
- Prior limitations

### How to Answer

Be prepared to:
- Answer honestly
- Explain baseline condition
- Describe what's different now
- Explain aggravation clearly

### Avoid Pitfalls

Don't:
- Hide prior conditions
- Exaggerate pre-accident status
- Claim perfect health before
- Be defensive about history

> [!TIP] Work with your attorney to prepare for questions about pre-existing conditions. Honest, well-explained testimony about your baseline and how the accident changed things is much more effective than trying to minimize your history.

## Special Situations

### Asymptomatic Conditions

When condition existed but caused no problems:

**Example:** Asymptomatic disc bulge
- MRI showed bulge before accident
- No symptoms before
- Accident caused symptoms

**Recovery:** Full damages - you were asymptomatic before.

### Dormant/Controlled Conditions

When condition was under control:

**Example:** Back pain managed with occasional PT
- Functioning well before
- Accident caused flare-up
- Now needs much more treatment

**Recovery:** Treatment to return to baseline, plus aggravation damages.

### Prior Similar Claims

When you've had similar claims before:

**Challenge:** Credibility at issue
**Strategy:** Distinguish this accident's impact
**Evidence:** Medical records showing stability between incidents

## Working With Your Attorney
