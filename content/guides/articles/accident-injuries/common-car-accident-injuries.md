## Common Car Accident Injuries

Car accidents cause a wide range of injuries, from minor bruises to life-threatening trauma. Understanding common injury types helps you recognize symptoms, seek appropriate treatment, and properly document your claim.

> [!INFO] Many car accident injuries don't show symptoms immediately. The adrenaline rush after an accident can mask pain, making it crucial to get checked even if you feel fine initially.

## Why Injury Documentation Matters

### For Your Health

Early detection and treatment:
- Prevents injuries from worsening
- Creates treatment plan
- Identifies hidden injuries
- Starts recovery sooner

### For Your Claim

Documentation proves:
- Injuries were caused by accident
- Severity of your condition
- Treatment was necessary
- Ongoing effects and prognosis

## Soft Tissue Injuries

### Whiplash
