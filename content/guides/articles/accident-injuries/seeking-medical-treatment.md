## Common Treatment Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Waiting Too Long

**Problem:** Days or weeks pass before seeking care.

**Solution:** See someone within 24-48 hours.

### Mistake 2: Gaps in Treatment

**Problem:** Inconsistent appointments or stopping treatment early.

**Impact:**

- Suggests injury isn't serious
- Weakens your claim

**Solution:** Follow treatment plan. If stopping, have doctor document why.

### Mistake 3: Not Mentioning All Symptoms

**Problem:** Focusing on main injury, not mentioning other symptoms.

**Impact:**
- Other injuries not documented
- Can't claim for undocumented injuries
- Treatment may be incomplete

**Solution:** Report every symptom at every visit.

### Mistake 4: Not Connecting to Accident

**Problem:** Symptoms described without mentioning accident.

**Impact:**
- Medical records don't link injury to accident

**Solution:** Always tell providers about the accident.

### Mistake 5: Seeking Only Chiropractic Care

**Problem:** Never seeing MD for serious injuries.

**Impact:**
