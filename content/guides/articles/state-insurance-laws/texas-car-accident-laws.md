## Texas Car Accident Laws: Complete Guide

Texas is the second-largest state with a massive road network and unique insurance laws. Understanding Texas's modified comparative fault system and insurance requirements is essential for the millions of drivers on Texas roads.

> [!INFO] Texas uses a modified comparative fault system with a 51% bar. If you're 51% or more at fault, you cannot recover any damages.

## Texas Fault System

### Modified Comparative Fault (51% Rule)

Texas follows proportionate responsibility:
- Your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage
- If you're 51% or more at fault, you recover nothing
- If you're 50% or less at fault, you can recover

**Examples:**
- 30% at fault with $100,000 damages: Recover $70,000
- 50% at fault with $100,000 damages: Recover $50,000
- 51% at fault with $100,000 damages: Recover $0

### How Fault Is Determined

In Texas, fault determination considers:
- Police accident reports
- Witness statements
- Physical evidence and photos
- Traffic law violations
- Video footage
- Expert accident reconstruction

### Joint and Several Liability

Texas has modified joint and several liability:
- Defendants 50% or less at fault: pay only their percentage
- Defendants over 50% at fault: may be jointly liable
- Affects recovery when multiple parties are at fault

## Texas Insurance Requirements
