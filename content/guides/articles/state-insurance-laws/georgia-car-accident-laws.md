## Georgia Car Accident Laws: Complete Guide

Georgia is a traditional at-fault state with modified comparative negligence rules. Understanding Georgia's insurance requirements and fault system is essential for the millions of drivers navigating Atlanta's notorious traffic and the state's extensive highway network.

> [!INFO] Georgia uses modified comparative fault with a 50% bar. If you're 50% or more at fault for an accident, you cannot recover any damages.

## Georgia's Fault System

### Modified Comparative Negligence (50% Rule)

Georgia follows modified comparative fault:
- Your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage
- If you're 50% or more at fault, you recover nothing
- If you're 49% or less at fault, you can recover

**Examples:**
- 20% at fault, $100,000 damages: Recover $80,000
- 49% at fault, $100,000 damages: Recover $51,000
- 50% at fault, $100,000 damages: Recover $0

### The 50% Threshold

Georgia's rule is particularly strict:
- At exactly 50%, you recover nothing
- This differs from 51% bar states
- One percentage point can mean total loss
- Fault determination is critical

### How Fault Is Determined

Georgia considers:
- Police reports and officer statements
- Witness testimony
- Physical evidence
- Traffic camera footage
- Vehicle damage patterns
- Expert reconstruction (serious cases)
