## Ohio Car Accident Laws: Complete Guide

Ohio is a traditional at-fault state with modified comparative negligence rules. Understanding Ohio's insurance requirements and fault system is essential for the millions of drivers navigating the state's highways and cities.

> [!INFO] Ohio uses modified comparative fault with a 51% bar. If you're 51% or more at fault, you cannot recover any damages from other parties.

## Ohio's Fault System

### Modified Comparative Negligence (51% Rule)

Ohio follows modified comparative fault:
- Your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage
- If you're 51% or more at fault, you recover nothing
- If you're 50% or less at fault, you can recover

**Examples:**
- 30% at fault, $100,000 damages: Recover $70,000
- 50% at fault, $100,000 damages: Recover $50,000
- 51% at fault, $100,000 damages: Recover $0

### Joint and Several Liability

Ohio modified joint and several liability:
- Economic damages: joint and several for defendants over 50% at fault
- Non-economic damages: several only (proportionate)
- Intentional torts: full joint and several

### How Fault Is Determined

Ohio considers:
- Police accident reports
- Witness testimony
- Physical evidence
