## Uninsured Motorist Coverage by State: Complete Guide

Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage (UM/UIM) is your safety net when the at-fault driver can't pay for your damages. Understanding how UM/UIM works in your state could be the difference between full compensation and financial disaster.

> [!WARNING] Approximately 12.6% of drivers nationwide are uninsured. In some states, the rate exceeds 20%. Without UM coverage, you may have no way to recover damages if hit by an uninsured driver.

## Understanding UM/UIM Coverage

### What Is Uninsured Motorist Coverage?

UM coverage protects you when:
- An at-fault driver has no insurance
- A hit-and-run driver can't be identified
- The at-fault driver's insurer is insolvent

### What Is Underinsured Motorist Coverage?

UIM coverage applies when:
- The at-fault driver has insurance
- But their coverage is insufficient for your damages
- Your UIM fills the gap

### What UM/UIM Covers

Depending on your policy:
- **UM Bodily Injury (UMBI):** Your injuries from uninsured driver
- **UM Property Damage (UMPD):** Your vehicle damage
- **UIM Bodily Injury:** Injuries exceeding at-fault coverage
- **UIM Property Damage:** Property damage exceeding at-fault coverage

## States That Require UM Coverage

### Mandatory UM States

These states require uninsured motorist coverage:

| State | UM Minimum | Can You Reject? |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| Connecticut | 25/50 | No |
| District of Columbia | 25/50 | No |
| Illinois | 25/50 | No (for BI) |
| Kansas | 25/50 | Yes, in writing |
| Maine | 50/100 | Yes, in writing |
| Maryland | 30/60 | No |
| Massachusetts | 20/40 | No |
| Minnesota | 25/50 | Yes, in writing |
| Missouri | 25/50 | Yes, in writing |
| Nebraska | 25/50 | Yes, in writing |
| New Jersey | 15/30 | No |
| New York | 25/50 | No |
| North Carolina | 30/60 | No |
| North Dakota | 25/50 | Yes, in writing |

| Virginia | 25/50 | Yes, in writing |
| West Virginia | 25/50 | Yes, in writing |
| Wisconsin | 25/50 | Yes, in writing |

### States Where UM Must Be Offered

Many states require insurers to offer UM even if not mandatory:

| State | Must Offer | Default if Not Rejected |
|-------|------------|------------------------|
| California | Yes | Included unless rejected |
| Georgia | Yes | Must offer |
| Ohio | Yes | Must offer |
| Texas | Yes | Must offer |
| Michigan | Yes | Must offer |
| Florida | Yes | Must offer |

> [!TIP] In states where UM must be offered, you typically need to reject it in writing. If you never signed a rejection, you may have coverage even if you didn't know it.

## How UM/UIM Works

### Filing a UM Claim

When to file:
1. At-fault driver has no insurance
2. At-fault driver fled (hit-and-run)
3. At-fault insurer is insolvent
4. Your damages exceed their coverage (UIM)

### The Claims Process

1. **Report accident** to your insurer
2. **Notify of UM claim** (may be same notification)
3. **Provide documentation** (medical bills, damages)
4. **Insurer investigates** fault and damages
5. **Negotiate settlement** with your own insurer
6. **Arbitration** if you can't agree (in many states)

### UM Claim Considerations

Important points:
- You're claiming against your own insurer
- They still investigate fault and damages
- May feel adversarial despite being your company
- Attorney may help with disputes

## Stacking vs. Non-Stacking

### What Is Stacking?

Stacking means combining UM coverage from:
- Multiple vehicles on your policy
- Multiple policies you hold
- Household members' policies

**Example of Stacking:**
- Two cars with $100,000 UM each
- Stacked: $200,000 available coverage
- Non-stacked: $100,000 maximum

### States Allowing Stacking

| State | Stacking Allowed |
|-------|------------------|
| Arizona | Yes |
| Delaware | Yes |
| Florida | Yes (inter-policy) |
| Maryland | Yes |
| New Jersey | Yes |
| Ohio | Yes (unless waived) |
| Pennsylvania | Yes |
| Wisconsin | Yes |

### States Prohibiting Stacking

| State | Stacking Status |
|-------|-----------------|
| California | Not allowed |
| Colorado | Not allowed |
| Georgia | Not allowed |
| Illinois | Not allowed |
| New York | Not allowed |
| Texas | Not allowed |

## Underinsured Motorist Coverage

### When UIM Applies

UIM kicks in when:
- At-fault driver has insurance
- Their limits are less than your damages
- Example: They have 25/50, your damages are $100,000

### Trigger Methods

States use different triggers:

**Damages trigger:**
- UIM applies when damages exceed at-fault coverage
- More common and favorable to consumers

**Limits trigger:**
- UIM applies only if at-fault limits are lower than your UIM limits
- Less favorable to consumers

### Reducing vs. Non-Reducing UIM

**Reducing (offset):**
- Your UIM reduced by amount collected from at-fault
- Example: $100K UIM - $25K collected = $75K available

**Non-reducing (true excess):**
- Your UIM pays on top of at-fault coverage
- Example: $100K UIM + $25K from at-fault = $125K total

## Hit-and-Run Coverage

### UM and Hit-and-Runs

Most UM policies cover hit-and-runs:
- Driver flees and can't be identified
- No license plate or witness identification
- Vehicle damage from unidentified vehicle

### Hit-and-Run Requirements

Some states require:
- Physical contact with the fleeing vehicle
- Police report within specific timeframe
- Witness corroboration
- Diligent effort to identify driver

### States with Physical Contact Requirement

| State | Physical Contact Required? |
|-------|---------------------------|
| California | No |
| Florida | Yes |
| Georgia | Varies by policy |
| Illinois | No |
| New York | Yes |
| Texas | No (for UMBI) |

## UM Coverage Recommendations

### How Much UM to Carry

General recommendations:
- Match your liability limits at minimum
- Consider $100,000/$300,000 or higher
- Maximum available if you have significant assets
- Umbrella policy may extend UM

### Cost Considerations

UM coverage typically:
- Costs $20-$50 per 6-month term
- Relatively inexpensive protection
- Worth far more than the premium
- Best value coverage available

> [!INFO] UM/UIM coverage typically provides the best value of any coverage you can buy. For a small premium, you get substantial protection against drivers who can't pay for your damages.

## Common UM Issues

### Disputes with Your Insurer

Even though it's your own company:
- They may dispute fault
- They may undervalue your claim
- Arbitration may be required
- Consider attorney for serious injuries

### Consent to Settle

Many policies require:
- You notify insurer before settling with at-fault
- Insurer must consent to the amount
- Preserves subrogation rights
- Failure to follow may void UIM coverage

### Subrogation Rights

After paying your UM claim:
- Insurer may pursue the uninsured driver
- If successful, may recover what they paid
- You may share in recovery (for deductible, etc.)

## State-Specific Issues

### Florida UM

- Not required but must be offered
- Can be stacked (inter-policy)
- UMPD has $500 deductible
- Must offer bodily injury and property damage separately

### California UM

- Must be offered; can reject in writing
- Covers economic damages primarily
- Arbitration for disputes
- No stacking allowed

### Texas UM

- Must be offered; UM/UIM combined
- Can reject in writing
- UIM uses difference method (reducing)
- PIP separate from UM

### New York UM

- Mandatory 25/50 minimum
- Supplementary UM (SUM) available for higher limits
- No-fault rules affect when UM applies
- Must meet serious injury threshold for pain and suffering
