## Minimum Insurance Coverage by State: Complete Guide

Every state sets its own minimum auto insurance requirements, and they vary dramatically. Understanding these requirements—and why they're usually not enough—can protect you financially after an accident.

> [!WARNING] State minimum coverage is almost always inadequate for serious accidents. Medical bills alone from a moderate injury accident often exceed $50,000, far more than most states' minimums.

## Understanding Liability Coverage

### What the Numbers Mean

Insurance limits are expressed as three numbers (e.g., 25/50/25):
- **First number:** Maximum per person for bodily injury
- **Second number:** Maximum per accident for all bodily injuries
- **Third number:** Maximum for property damage

**Example: 25/50/25 means:**
- Up to $25,000 for one person's injuries
- Up to $50,000 total if multiple people injured
- Up to $25,000 for property damage

### What Liability Covers

Liability insurance pays:
- Other people's medical expenses
- Other people's lost wages
- Other people's pain and suffering
- Damage to other people's property
- Your legal defense costs

**It does NOT cover:**
- Your own injuries
- Your own vehicle damage
- Damage when you're not at fault

## No-Fault State Additional Requirements

### PIP (Personal Injury Protection)

| State | PIP Minimum |
|-------|-------------|

| Kentucky | $10,000 |
| Massachusetts | $8,000 |
| Michigan | Unlimited (opt-down available) |
| Minnesota | $40,000 |
| New Jersey | $15,000 |
| New York | $50,000 |
| North Dakota | $30,000 |
| Pennsylvania | $5,000 |
| Utah | $3,000 |

### What PIP Covers

PIP typically pays for:
- Medical expenses
- Lost wages (usually 60-80%)
- Essential services
- Funeral expenses

## Uninsured Motorist Requirements

### States Requiring UM Coverage

Some states mandate uninsured motorist coverage:

| State | UM Required | Minimum |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Connecticut | Yes | 25/50 |
| Illinois | Yes | 25/50 |
| Kansas | Yes | 25/50 |
| Maine | Yes | 50/100 |
| Maryland | Yes | 30/60 |
| Massachusetts | Yes | 20/40 |
| Minnesota | Yes | 25/50 |
| Missouri | Yes | 25/50 |
| Nebraska | Yes | 25/50 |
| New Jersey | Yes | 15/30 |
| New York | Yes | 25/50 |
| North Carolina | Yes | 30/60 |
| Oregon | Yes | 25/50 |
| South Carolina | Yes | 25/50 |
| Vermont | Yes | 50/100 |
| West Virginia | Yes | 25/50 |

> [!TIP] Even in states where UM/UIM isn't required, you should carry it. About 12-15% of drivers nationwide are uninsured, and this coverage protects you when they cause accidents.

## Why Minimums Aren't Enough

### Medical Cost Reality

Average medical costs from auto accidents:
- Emergency room visit: $3,000-$10,000
- Ambulance transport: $1,000-$2,000
- Hospitalization per day: $2,500-$5,000
- Surgery: $10,000-$100,000+
- Rehabilitation: $1,000-$5,000/month

A moderate injury can easily exceed $50,000 in medical bills.

### Property Damage Reality

Average vehicle costs:
- New car average price: $48,000+
- Luxury vehicle: $75,000+
- Trucks/SUVs: $50,000+
- Total loss of newer vehicle easily exceeds $25,000

### What Happens When You're Underinsured

If you cause an accident and damages exceed your coverage:
- You're personally liable for the excess
- Can be sued and wages garnished
- Assets can be seized
- May face bankruptcy
- Judgment can follow you for years

## Recommended Coverage Levels

### Financial Experts Recommend

| Coverage Type | Minimum Recommended |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Bodily Injury | 100/300 |
| Property Damage | $100,000 |
| Uninsured Motorist | Match liability limits |
| Underinsured Motorist | Match liability limits |

### High Net Worth Individuals

If you have significant assets:
- Consider 250/500/250 or higher
- Add umbrella policy ($1M-$5M)
- Umbrella provides excess liability coverage
- Protects personal assets from lawsuits

### Cost Difference

The cost difference between minimums and adequate coverage is often surprisingly small:
- Minimum coverage: ~$100/month
- Adequate coverage: ~$125-$150/month
- The extra $25-$50/month provides dramatically better protection

## Special Coverage Considerations

### Medical Payments Coverage

Medical payments (MedPay):
- Pays your medical bills regardless of fault
- No deductible
- Works with health insurance
- Low cost addition ($3-$10/month)
- Recommended: $5,000-$10,000

### Collision Coverage

For your own vehicle:
- Pays for your car damage in accident
- Has deductible ($250-$1,000 typical)
- Required if you have car loan
- Worth carrying on newer vehicles

### Comprehensive Coverage

For non-collision damage:
- Theft, vandalism, weather, animals
- Usually has deductible
- Required if you have car loan
- Worth carrying on newer vehicles

## What Happens After an Underinsured Accident

### If the Other Driver Is Underinsured

Your options:
1. Collect their full policy limits
2. File UIM claim with your insurer (if you have coverage)
3. Sue the driver personally
4. May collect little if driver has no assets

### If You're Underinsured

What happens:
1. Your insurance pays up to limits
2. You're personally liable for remainder
3. Other party may sue you
4. Your assets may be at risk
5. Wages could be garnished
