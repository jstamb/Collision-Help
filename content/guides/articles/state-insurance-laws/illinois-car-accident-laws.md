## Illinois Car Accident Laws: Complete Guide

Illinois is a traditional at-fault state with modified comparative negligence rules. Understanding Illinois's insurance requirements is essential for navigating Chicago's congested expressways and the state's extensive road network.

### Modified Comparative Negligence (51% Rule)

Illinois follows modified comparative fault:

**Examples:**
- 25% at fault, $100,000 damages: Recover $75,000
- 50% at fault, $100,000 damages: Recover $50,000
- 51% at fault, $100,000 damages: Recover $0
