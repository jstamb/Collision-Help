## Accident Lawsuit Deadlines by State: Complete Guide

Missing the statute of limitations deadline means losing your right to sue forever. Every state sets different deadlines for personal injury and property damage claims, and some have surprisingly short timeframes.

> [!WARNING] Once the statute of limitations expires, you cannot file a lawsuit—period. Courts will dismiss your case regardless of how strong your claim is or how severe your injuries are.

## What Is the Statute of Limitations?

### Basic Definition

The statute of limitations is:
- The legal deadline to file a lawsuit
- Set by state law
- Starts from the date of the accident (usually)
- Different for different types of claims
- Missing it bars your claim permanently

### Why Deadlines Exist

Statutes of limitations serve purposes:
- Encourage prompt pursuit of claims
- Preserve evidence while still fresh
- Protect defendants from stale claims
- Provide legal certainty
- Prevent indefinite exposure to lawsuits

### When the Clock Starts

Generally, the deadline starts:
- On the date of the accident
- On the date injury was discovered (sometimes)
- On the date of death (wrongful death claims)
- For minors: often when they turn 18

- **Kentucky:** 1 year for personal injury
- **Louisiana:** 1 year for personal injury (called "prescription")
- **Tennessee:** 1 year for personal injury

> [!TIP] If you're injured in Kentucky, Louisiana, or Tennessee, act immediately. One year passes faster than you think, especially when recovering from injuries.

### Longest Deadlines

States with longer deadlines:
- **Maine:** 6 years
- **Minnesota:** 6 years
- **North Dakota:** 6 years
- **Missouri:** 5 years

### Property Damage Deadlines

Property damage often has different (usually longer) deadlines:

|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| California | 2 years | 3 years |
| Florida | 2 years | 4 years |
| Georgia | 2 years | 4 years |
| New York | 3 years | 3 years |
| Texas | 2 years | 2 years |
| Illinois | 2 years | 5 years |

## Government Claim Deadlines

### Why Government Claims Are Different

Claims against government entities have:
- Shorter notice requirements
- Special forms required
- Different procedures
- Sovereign immunity issues
- Often much shorter deadlines

### Notice of Claim Requirements

Many states require notice before suing government:

| State | Notice Deadline | Then File Within |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| California | 6 months | 6 months after denial |
| Florida | 3 years, but 6 months recommended | After notice period |
| New York | 90 days | 1 year 90 days |
| Texas | 6 months | Varies |
| Georgia | 12 months | 2 years |
| Illinois | 1 year | 1 year after denial |

> [!WARNING] Government claim deadlines are often much shorter than regular statutes of limitations. Missing the notice deadline can bar your entire claim.

### Federal Government Claims

Claims against federal agencies (USPS trucks, military vehicles, etc.):
- File administrative claim within 2 years
- Under the Federal Tort Claims Act
- Must exhaust administrative remedies
- Then 6 months to file suit after denial

## Special Circumstances

### Minors (Children)

Most states "toll" (pause) the deadline for minors:
- Clock often starts when child turns 18
- Some states have maximum age limits
- Parent/guardian may still have separate deadline
- Varies significantly by state

**Example (California):**
- Minor injured at age 10
- Clock starts at age 18
- Has until age 20 to file (18 + 2 years)

### Discovery Rule

Some injuries aren't immediately apparent:
- Deadline may start when injury discovered
- Or when injury reasonably should have been discovered
- Applies to latent injuries
- Must prove lack of knowledge was reasonable

### Defendants Who Leave the State

If the at-fault party leaves the state:
- Statute may be "tolled" (paused)
- Time spent out of state doesn't count
- Varies significantly by state
- Consult attorney for specifics

### Mental Incapacity

If injury victim is mentally incapacitated:
- Deadline may be tolled
- Must prove incapacity
- May have maximum time limits
- Varies by state

## Wrongful Death Deadlines

Wrongful death claims often have different deadlines:

| State | Wrongful Death Deadline |
|-------|-------------------------|
| California | 2 years from death |
| Florida | 2 years from death |
| Georgia | 2 years from death |
| New York | 2 years from death |
| Texas | 2 years from death |
| Kentucky | 1 year from death |
| Tennessee | 1 year from death |

## Insurance Claim vs. Lawsuit Deadlines

### Different Deadlines

Insurance claims and lawsuits have different timing:
- Insurance claims: policy deadline (often 30-90 days to report)
- Lawsuits: statute of limitations (1-6 years)
- Both must be met for full protection

### When Insurance Claims Affect Lawsuits

- Filing insurance claim doesn't extend lawsuit deadline
- Settlement negotiations don't extend deadline
- Must file suit before deadline regardless of claim status
- Insurance may settle after suit filed

## Protecting Your Rights

### Don't Wait

Even with longer deadlines:
- Evidence disappears over time
- Witnesses forget details
- Medical connections become harder to prove
- Insurance companies may be suspicious of delays

### Get Legal Advice Early

Consult an attorney:
- To confirm your specific deadline
- For claims involving multiple states
- When government entities are involved
- If discovery rule might apply
- For complex injury scenarios

### Calendar the Deadline

Create multiple reminders:
- At 6 months before deadline
- At 3 months before deadline
- At 1 month before deadline
- Don't rely on memory alone
