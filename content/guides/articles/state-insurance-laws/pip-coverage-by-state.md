## PIP Coverage Requirements by State: Complete Guide

Personal Injury Protection (PIP) is a key component of no-fault insurance systems. Understanding PIP requirements, coverage limits, and how it works in your state can help you get proper medical care after an accident without waiting for fault determination.

> [!INFO] PIP coverage pays for your medical expenses and lost wages regardless of who caused the accident. It's mandatory in no-fault states and optional (but valuable) in at-fault states.

## What Is PIP Coverage?

### Basic Definition

Personal Injury Protection (PIP) covers:
- Medical expenses from car accidents
- Lost wages while recovering
- Essential services you can't perform
- Funeral expenses (in some states)
- Applies regardless of fault

### How PIP Differs from Other Coverage

| Coverage | Pays For | Fault Matter? |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| PIP | Your injuries | No |
| MedPay | Your medical bills | No |
| Liability | Others' injuries | Yes (you at fault) |
| UM/UIM | Your injuries | Yes (other at fault) |

### PIP vs. MedPay

Both cover your medical expenses, but:
- **PIP:** Includes lost wages, essential services; required in no-fault states
- **MedPay:** Medical expenses only; optional in most states
- **PIP:** Often has more requirements (time limits, authorized providers)
- **MedPay:** Generally simpler to use
