## California Car Accident Laws: Complete Guide

California has some of the busiest roads in America and its own unique set of insurance and accident laws. Understanding California's pure comparative negligence system, minimum requirements, and claims process is essential for any driver in the Golden State.

> [!INFO] California uses a pure comparative negligence system, meaning you can recover damages even if you're 99% at fault—though your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage.

## California's Fault System

### Pure Comparative Negligence

California follows pure comparative negligence:
- Your damages are reduced by your percentage of fault
- You can recover even if mostly at fault
- No threshold that bars recovery
- Each party pays their proportional share

**Example:**
$100,000 in damages, you're 60% at fault
Recovery: $40,000 (100% - 60%)

### How Fault Is Determined

In California, fault is determined by:
- Police investigation and reports
- Insurance adjuster investigation
- Witness statements
- Physical evidence
- Traffic camera footage
- Expert accident reconstruction

### Disputing Fault

You can challenge fault determination by:
- Providing additional evidence
- Getting independent witnesses
- Hiring accident reconstructionists
- Pointing out CVC violations by other driver
- Filing complaint with CDI if insurer is unfair

## California Insurance Requirements

### Minimum Liability Coverage

California requires these minimums (15/30/5):
- **$15,000** bodily injury per person
