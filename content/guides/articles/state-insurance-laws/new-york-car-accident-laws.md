## New York Car Accident Laws: Complete Guide

New York is one of the true no-fault insurance states, with mandatory Personal Injury Protection (PIP) and restrictions on when you can sue. Understanding New York's unique insurance system is essential for the millions of drivers in the Empire State.

> [!INFO] New York is a no-fault state. Your own insurance pays for your medical bills regardless of who caused the accident, and you can only sue for serious injuries meeting the "serious injury threshold."

## New York's No-Fault System

### How No-Fault Works

In New York's no-fault system:
- Your own PIP pays your medical expenses
- Works regardless of who caused the accident
- Covers up to $50,000 in basic expenses
- Eliminates most minor injury lawsuits
- Property damage claims still follow fault rules

### What No-Fault/PIP Covers

New York PIP (Basic Economic Loss) covers:
- Medical expenses related to the accident
- Lost wages (80% of earnings, up to $2,000/month)
- Other reasonable and necessary expenses
- Up to $50,000 total in benefits

### Filing a No-Fault Claim

To receive PIP benefits:
1. Report accident to your insurer immediately
2. File application within 30 days of accident
3. Submit medical bills as treatment occurs
4. Claim lost wages with employer verification
5. Benefits paid regardless of fault

> [!TIP] The 30-day deadline to file your no-fault application is strict. Late applications can be denied, leaving you without coverage for medical expenses.

## The Serious Injury Threshold

### When You Can Sue

To sue for pain and suffering in New York, your injury must meet the "serious injury" threshold:
- Significant disfigurement
- Bone fracture

- Substantially full disability for 90 days or more

### Types of Qualifying Injuries

**Clear threshold injuries:**

### The 90-Day Rule

One threshold option requires:
