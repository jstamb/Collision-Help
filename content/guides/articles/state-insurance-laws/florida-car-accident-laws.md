## Florida Car Accident Laws: Complete Guide

Florida's insurance and accident laws changed significantly in 2023, transitioning from a no-fault state to a modified comparative fault system. Understanding these changes is critical for anyone involved in a Florida car accident.

> [!WARNING] Major change: As of March 2023, Florida eliminated its no-fault PIP requirement and moved to a comparative fault system with a 51% bar. Drivers must now carry bodily injury liability coverage.

## Florida's New Fault System (2023)

### Modified Comparative Negligence

Florida now uses modified comparative negligence:
- Your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage
- If you're more than 50% at fault, you recover nothing
- This replaced Florida's previous pure comparative system

**Examples:**
- 30% at fault, $100,000 damages: Recover $70,000
- 50% at fault, $100,000 damages: Recover $50,000
- 51% at fault, $100,000 damages: Recover $0

### The 2023 Law Change

Key changes from the 2023 tort reform:
- No more mandatory PIP coverage
- Bodily injury liability now required
- Changed from pure to modified comparative fault
- Reduced statute of limitations to 2 years
- Bad faith law changes

> [!INFO] If your accident occurred before March 24, 2023, the old no-fault rules may still apply. The date of accident determines which law governs your case.

## Florida Insurance Requirements

### Current Minimums (After 2023)

Florida now requires:
