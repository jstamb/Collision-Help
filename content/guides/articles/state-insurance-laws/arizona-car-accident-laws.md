## Arizona Car Accident Laws: Complete Guide

Arizona is a traditional at-fault state with one of the most favorable fault systems for injured parties—pure comparative negligence. Understanding Arizona's insurance requirements and desert driving challenges is essential for navigating the state's unique road conditions.

> [!INFO] Arizona uses pure comparative negligence, meaning you can recover damages even if you're 99% at fault—though your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage.

## Arizona's Fault System

### Pure Comparative Negligence

Arizona follows pure comparative negligence:
- Your damages are reduced by your percentage of fault
- You can recover even if mostly at fault
- No threshold that bars recovery entirely
- Each party pays their proportional share

**Examples:**
- 20% at fault, $100,000 damages: Recover $80,000
- 70% at fault, $100,000 damages: Recover $30,000
- 99% at fault, $100,000 damages: Recover $1,000

### Benefit of Pure Comparative

Arizona's system is generous:
- Even mostly at-fault parties can recover
- Encourages settlement negotiation
- Reduces "all-or-nothing" outcomes
- Allows partial recovery in close cases

### How Fault Is Determined

Arizona considers:
- Police accident reports
- Witness statements
- Physical evidence
- Traffic camera footage
- Expert reconstruction
- Arizona traffic law violations
