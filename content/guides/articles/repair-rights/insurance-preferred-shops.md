## What Are Insurance Preferred Shops?

Insurance preferred shops - also called Direct Repair Program (DRP) shops - are body shops that have formal agreements with insurance companies. In exchange for referrals, these shops agree to specific terms that benefit the insurer.

> [!INFO] DRP shops aren't inherently bad, but understanding the arrangement helps you make informed decisions about where to repair your car.

## How Direct Repair Programs Work

### The Basic Agreement

Insurance company agrees to:
- Send customers to the shop
- Streamline approval processes
- Provide steady work flow
- List shop as "preferred" or "approved"

Shop agrees to:
- Accept insurance company's labor rates
- Follow insurance guidelines
- Use specified parts (often aftermarket)
- Meet certain cycle time requirements
- Guarantee work to insurance standards

### The Financial Arrangement

DRP shops typically accept:
- 10-20% lower labor rates than market
- Caps on certain repair procedures
- Parts sourcing requirements
- Profit margins the insurance dictates

## Potential Advantages of Preferred Shops

### For You

- **Convenience** - Pre-approved, no estimate hassles
- **Speed** - Faster authorization process
- **Guarantee** - Insurance often backs the work
- **Direct billing** - Less paperwork for you
- **Rental coordination** - Often handled automatically

### Reality Check

These advantages assume the shop does quality work. A bad DRP shop gives you fast, convenient poor repairs.

## Potential Disadvantages of Preferred Shops

### Quality Concerns

**Parts pressure:**
- Required to use aftermarket parts
- May not be able to install OEM even if you pay extra
- Parts shortcuts to meet margins

**Time pressure:**
- Cycle time requirements from insurance
- Pressure to rush repairs
- May skip proper procedures

**Financial pressure:**
- Lower labor rates = less time on your car
- Cutting corners to maintain profitability
- Workers paid based on speed, not quality

### Conflict of Interest

The DRP shop's customer is the insurance company, not you:
- Insurance sends them work
- Insurance sets their rates
- Insurance can remove them from program
- Insurance reviews their performance metrics

> [!WARNING] When there's a conflict between what's best for you and what insurance wants, who do you think the DRP shop will favor?

## Questions to Ask DRP Shops

Before using a preferred shop, ask:

### About Parts

1. "Can I choose OEM parts if I pay the difference?"
2. "What brands of aftermarket parts do you use?"
3. "Do you use recycled parts, and can I refuse them?"

### About Process

4. "Who writes your repair estimates - you or insurance?"
5. "What happens if you find hidden damage?"
6. "How long do repairs typically take for my type of damage?"

### About Quality

7. "Are you I-CAR Gold Class certified?"
8. "Do you follow manufacturer repair procedures?"
9. "What warranty do YOU provide on the work?"

### About Transparency

10. "Can I see the estimate before repairs begin?"
11. "Will you show me parts before installing?"
12. "Can I inspect during the repair process?"

## Red Flags at Preferred Shops

### Warning Signs

- Won't answer questions about parts
- Say they "have to" use aftermarket
- Can't explain insurance relationship
- Pressure you to sign quickly

## How to Evaluate a Preferred Shop

### Do Your Research First

Don't just accept the referral. Research the specific shop:
- Read online reviews (Google, Yelp)
- Check BBB rating and complaints
- Verify certifications (I-CAR, OEM)
- Ask friends/family about experiences

### Visit in Person

Before committing:
- Tour the facility
- Meet the staff
- Ask about their insurance relationship
- Look at current repairs in progress
- Trust your instincts

### Compare to Independent Shops

Get an estimate from a non-DRP shop:
- Compare repair procedures
- Compare parts specified

- Compare warranty offerings

## When DRP Shops Make Sense

### Good Candidates for Preferred Shops

- Minor damage repairs
- Cosmetic-only work
- Older vehicles
- When convenience is priority
- If specific shop has great reputation
- When time is critical

### When to Choose Independent

- Newer vehicles (under 5 years)
- Luxury or specialty vehicles
- Structural damage involved
- When quality is top priority
- If you have a trusted shop
- When you want OEM parts

## The Insurance Guarantee

Many insurers guarantee work at preferred shops:

### What It Doesn't Mean

### How to Use the Guarantee

If problems arise:
1. Document the issue
2. Contact original shop first

5. Request re-repair at another shop if needed
