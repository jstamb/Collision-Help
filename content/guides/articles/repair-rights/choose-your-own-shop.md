## Your Right to Choose

In all 50 states, you have the legal right to choose which body shop repairs your vehicle after an accident. This isn't just a privilege - it's consumer protection law. Insurance companies cannot force you to use their preferred shops.

> [!INFO] No insurance company can require you to use a specific repair shop. They may recommend shops, but the choice is always yours.

## Why Insurance Companies Push Preferred Shops

Insurance companies have Direct Repair Programs (DRPs) with preferred body shops. Here's why they prefer you use them:

### Benefits for Insurers

- **Discounted rates** - DRP shops agree to lower labor rates
- **Parts agreements** - Shops use more aftermarket parts
- **Faster processing** - Streamlined paperwork
- **Warranty shifting** - Shop handles complaints
- **Cost control** - Insurance company negotiates prices

### The Trade-Off

What you might give up at a DRP shop:
- OEM parts may be substituted with aftermarket
- Labor rates may be below market
- Pressure to cut corners to maintain DRP status
- Insurance company's interests prioritized over yours

## Common Pressure Tactics

### Tactic 1: "We Only Guarantee Work at Our Shops"

**Reality:** Your insurer must pay for proper repairs regardless of shop. Any reputable shop provides their own warranty.

**Response:** "I understand. [Shop name] provides a lifetime warranty on their work, which I'm comfortable with."

### Tactic 2: "It Will Take Longer at Non-Preferred Shops"

**Reality:** May be slightly slower due to supplement approval process, but not significantly.

**Response:** "I'm willing to wait for quality repairs at a shop I trust."

### Tactic 3: "We Can't Guarantee the Same Price"

**Reality:** They must pay reasonable repair costs regardless of shop.

**Response:** "I've gotten an estimate from [shop]. Please send an adjuster to write your estimate there."

### Tactic 4: "We Won't Pay More Than Our Estimate"

**Reality:** If your shop's estimate is reasonable, they must negotiate. If hidden damage is found, supplements are normal.

**Response:** "I understand you have an estimate. My shop and your adjuster can work together on the final repair cost."

> [!WARNING] If an insurer says they "won't pay" for your chosen shop, ask for that in writing and the specific policy language. They usually back down.

## How to Exercise Your Right

### Step 1: Choose Your Shop First

Before contacting insurance:
- Research body shops in your area
- Check reviews and certifications
- Ask about insurance claim experience
- Get recommendations from friends/family

### Step 2: Inform Your Insurance

When filing your claim:
> "I'll be using [shop name] for repairs. Please send an adjuster to their location to write the estimate."

### Step 3: Get Estimate Written at Your Shop

Request the insurance adjuster meet at your chosen shop:
- Your shop can point out all damage
- Estimate reflects their actual costs
- Reduces supplement disputes later

### Step 4: Authorize Repairs

Once estimate is agreed upon:
- Sign shop's repair authorization
- Understand your deductible obligation
- Get timeline estimate
- Discuss any coverage questions

## What If There's a Price Dispute?

Sometimes your shop's estimate exceeds the insurance estimate.

### Legitimate Differences

- Different labor rates
- OEM vs. aftermarket parts
- Different repair procedures
- Hidden damage inclusion

### Resolution Steps

1. **Have shop and adjuster communicate** - Often resolves directly
2. **Request supplement process** - For hidden damage
3. **Negotiate differences** - Meet in the middle
4. **Escalate to supervisor** - If adjuster is unreasonable
5. **Invoke appraisal clause** - For significant disputes

### Your Options if They Won't Pay

- Pay the difference yourself (last resort)
- File complaint with state insurance department
- Consider different shop if difference is significant
- Small claims court for unreasonable denials
