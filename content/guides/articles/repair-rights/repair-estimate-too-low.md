## Why Insurance Estimates Are Often Low

Insurance company repair estimates are often lower than what shops actually charge. This isn't accidental - insurers have financial incentives to minimize repair costs. Understanding why estimates are low helps you fight for fair payment.

> [!INFO] Initial insurance estimates are typically 15-30% below actual repair costs. The supplement process exists because hidden damage is nearly always found during repairs.

## Common Ways Estimates Fall Short

### Labor Rate Issues

**The problem:** Insurers use negotiated rates below market average.

| Labor Type | Insurance Rate | Market Rate |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| Body repair | $45-55/hour | $55-75/hour |
| Paint | $48-58/hour | $58-85/hour |
| Mechanical | $85-100/hour | $100-140/hour |
| Frame | $70-85/hour | $85-110/hour |

### Labor Time Issues

**The problem:** Insurance estimates fewer hours than needed.

- Estimating systems outdated
- Don't account for difficult access
- Miss included operations
- Assume perfect conditions

### Parts Pricing Issues

**The problem:** Using aftermarket or LKQ pricing for OEM repairs.

- Quote aftermarket, shop installs OEM
- Old pricing databases
- Not including all required parts
- Missing small items (clips, fasteners, adhesive)

### Missing Damage

**The problem:** Visual inspection misses internal damage.

- Can't see behind panels
- Structural damage hidden
- Mechanical components affected
- Electrical issues not apparent

## Signs Your Estimate is Too Low

### Compare to Shop Estimates

Get at least one independent estimate and compare:
- Line-by-line operation differences
- Labor rate differences
- Parts pricing differences
- Total difference

### Red Flags in Estimate

- Labor rates far below market
- Missing obvious damage
- Only aftermarket parts listed
- No paint blend time
- Missing prep operations
- No clips/fasteners/hardware

### What Body Shops Say

Shop concerns might include:
- "This won't cover the repair"
- "They missed the damage here"
- "These parts aren't available"
- "Their labor time is impossible"

## How to Challenge a Low Estimate

### Step 1: Document the Deficiencies

Create a side-by-side comparison:

| Item | Insurance Estimate | Shop Estimate | Difference |
|------|-------------------|---------------|------------|
| Labor rate | $50/hr | $65/hr | $15/hr |
| Labor hours | 12 | 16 | 4 hours |
| Parts (subtotal) | $1,500 | $2,200 | $700 |
| **Total** | **$2,600** | **$4,020** | **$1,420** |

### Step 2: Request a Re-Inspection

Ask your adjuster to:
- Meet at your shop
- Re-inspect with shop present
- Have shop point out missed damage
- Write a new estimate on-site

### Step 3: Provide Supporting Evidence

Gather documentation:
- Shop's detailed estimate
- Photos of damage
- Labor rate surveys for your area
- Parts pricing from multiple sources
- Industry repair procedures

### Step 4: Negotiate Specifically

Don't ask for vague increases. Instead:
> "Your estimate has body labor at $50/hour. The average in our area is $65. Here's a survey showing market rates. Please adjust the labor rate to $65/hour."

### Step 5: Use the Supplement Process

If estimate doesn't cover everything:
- Authorize repairs based on current estimate
- Shop documents additional damage during repair
- Shop submits supplement request
- Adjuster approves additional costs

> [!TIP] The supplement process is normal and expected. Good shops handle dozens of supplements weekly.

## Dealing With Specific Estimate Problems

### Low Labor Rates

**Your argument:**
- Survey local shop rates
- Show your shop's posted rates
- Cite database surveys (like Mitchell)
- Compare to dealer rates

**What to say:**
> "Your rate of $50/hour is below market. I've contacted five shops, and the average is $62/hour. My shop charges $60, which is reasonable. Please adjust."

### Insufficient Labor Hours

**Your argument:**
- Compare to manufacturer repair procedures
- Show access issues requiring more time
- Document non-included operations
- Reference estimating guides

**What to say:**
> "Your estimate includes 4 hours for this repair. The manufacturer procedure calls for 6.5 hours, and this vehicle has additional access requirements. Please adjust to 6.5 hours."

### Parts Pricing

**Your argument:**
- Provide dealer parts quotes
- Show parts aren't available aftermarket
- Demonstrate quality differences
- Request OEM for proper repair

**What to say:**
> "Your estimate uses aftermarket pricing, but that part has fit issues. Here's documentation from the shop. OEM costs $200 more but ensures proper repair."

### Missing Damage

**Your argument:**
- Provide additional photos
- Get shop's damage assessment in writing
- Show how damage is connected
- Request tear-down for full assessment

**What to say:**
> "Your estimate only covers visible damage. My shop identified additional damage to [components] that's directly related. Please arrange for a re-inspection."

## The Supplement Process Explained

Supplements are additional payments for damage found during repair.

### How Supplements Work

1. Shop starts tear-down/disassembly
2. Hidden damage discovered
3. Shop documents with photos
4. Shop writes supplement estimate
5. Submits to insurance
6. Adjuster reviews (may visit shop)
7. Additional amount approved
8. Repairs continue

### Typical Supplement Timing

| Stage | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| Damage discovered | During repair |
| Supplement submitted | Same day or next |
| Insurance review | 1-3 days |
| Approval | 1-5 days |
| Repair continues | After approval |

### What If Supplement Is Denied?

If insurance won't approve legitimate supplement:
- Request written denial with specific reason
- Have shop provide additional documentation
- Ask for supervisor review
- Escalate to manager if needed
- File state insurance complaint

## Your Rights During Estimate Disputes

### What Insurance Must Do

- Provide detailed written estimate
- Pay reasonable repair costs
- Consider shop's documentation
- Respond to supplements timely
- Negotiate in good faith

### What Insurance Cannot Do

- Refuse to pay for proper repairs
- Ignore documented damage
- Force below-market labor rates
- Require specific shops
- Cap payments arbitrarily

### When to Escalate

Escalate beyond your adjuster when:
- Repeated requests are ignored
- Explanations don't make sense
- Estimates remain unreasonably low
- Supplements are denied without cause
- Communication breaks down

## Using Appraisal for Estimate Disputes

If you can't reach agreement:

### The Appraisal Process

1. You hire an appraiser ($150-400)
2. Insurance hires an appraiser
3. Both appraisers negotiate
4. If no agreement, they select umpire
5. Two of three agreeing sets value

### When to Use Appraisal

- Gap exceeds $1,500-2,000
- Insurance won't negotiate
- You have strong documentation
- Shop supports your position

> [!WARNING] Appraisal costs money upfront. Use it for significant disputes, not small differences.

## Prevention: Getting Better Estimates Initially

### Have Estimate Written at Your Shop

When adjuster writes estimate at your shop:
- Shop can point out all damage
- Labor rates match from start
- Parts discussion happens early
- Fewer supplements needed

### Be Present for Inspection

When adjuster inspects:
- Point out damage they might miss
- Mention mechanical issues
- Note any leaks or warning lights
- Ask them to document everything
