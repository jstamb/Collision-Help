## When Repairs Go Wrong

You trusted a body shop with your car, but the repairs aren't right. Panels don't align, paint doesn't match, or worse - the car doesn't drive correctly. Understanding your options helps you get the repairs fixed properly.

> [!INFO] Poor repairs happen more often than you'd think. Reputable shops will make things right. Your challenge is holding them accountable when they don't.

## Signs of a Bad Repair Job

### Visual Problems

**Paint Issues:**
- Color doesn't match adjacent panels
- Orange peel texture
- Runs or drips visible
- Clear coat peeling
- Paint on trim or glass
- Overspray on surrounding areas

**Body Panel Issues:**
- Uneven gaps around doors/hood/trunk
- Panels not flush with body
- Visible ripples or waves
- Pinch welds visible
- Misaligned headlights/taillights

### Functional Problems

**Operational Issues:**
- Doors don't close smoothly
- Hood/trunk don't latch properly
- Windows don't seal correctly
- Water leaks into cabin
- Wind noise at highway speeds

**Mechanical Problems:**
- Car pulls to one side
- Vibration at certain speeds

- Unusual noises
- Warning lights appearing

### Structural Concerns

**Safety Red Flags:**
- Frame/unibody issues
- Airbag system warnings
- Seatbelt anchors feel loose
- Suspension seems wrong
- Vehicle sits unevenly

> [!WARNING] If you notice safety-related issues after repair (warning lights, structural concerns), address them immediately. Don't drive the vehicle until inspected.

## Step 1: Document Everything

Before doing anything else, create evidence:

### Photos to Take

- All problem areas from multiple angles
- Comparison to undamaged areas
- Close-ups showing defects
- Wide shots showing overall issues
- Paint color differences in various lighting

### Written Documentation

- Date you picked up vehicle
- Date you noticed problems
- Specific description of each issue
- Any conversations with shop
- Names of people you spoke with

### Video Documentation

- Walk around showing issues
- Demonstrate functional problems
- Record any unusual sounds
- Narrate what you're showing

## Step 2: Return to the Original Shop

Give the shop one opportunity to make it right:

### How to Approach

Be factual, not emotional:
> "I picked up my car on [date]. I've noticed several issues with the repair that need to be addressed. Specifically: [list issues]. I'd like to schedule a time to bring it back so you can inspect and correct these problems."

### What to Request

- Inspection of all concerns
- Written acknowledgment of problems
- Timeline for repairs
- Rental car if repair takes time
- Written guarantee on corrected work

### Document This Conversation

- Who you spoke with
- What they agreed to
- Timeline promised
- Get confirmation in writing/email

## Step 3: If the Shop Won't Help

When the original shop refuses or can't fix the problems:

### Escalate Within the Shop

- Ask for owner or manager
- Explain issue history
- Show documentation
- Request formal response
- Get denials in writing

### Independent Inspection

Get a second opinion from:
- Another reputable body shop
- Manufacturer-certified shop
- Independent appraiser
- Frame/alignment specialist

Ask for:
- Written assessment of problems
- What repairs are needed
- Cost to fix properly
- Whether original work was substandard

## Step 4: Involve Your Insurance Company

If insurance paid for the repair, they have stake in this:

### Contact Your Adjuster

> "I'm having issues with the repairs to my vehicle. [Shop name] either can't or won't correct the problems. I'd like your assistance in resolving this."

### What Insurance Can Do

- Reinspect the vehicle
- Authorize re-repairs at another shop
- Pursue the original shop directly
- Apply pressure through their DRP program

### Preferred Shop vs. Your Choice

If you used their preferred shop:
- Insurance is more accountable
- They may fix issues quickly
- DRP shops can lose status

If you chose the shop:
- Less insurance leverage
- Still responsible for paying proper repairs
- May need to involve their adjuster

> [!TIP] If you used an insurance-preferred shop, the insurance company often guarantees the work. This gives you significant leverage.

## Step 5: Formal Complaints

When direct resolution fails:

### State Attorney General

File consumer protection complaint:
- Document the problem
- Show repair attempts
- Request investigation
- May prompt resolution

### Better Business Bureau

File BBB complaint:
- Public record
- Shop may respond to protect rating
- Can help mediate dispute
- Free to file

### State Licensing Board

Many states license auto body shops:
- File complaint with licensing authority
- Can result in investigation
- May affect shop's license
- Creates official record

### Online Reviews

Document your experience:
- Be factual, not inflammatory
- Include dates and specifics
- Mention resolution attempts
- Update if resolved

## Step 6: Legal Options

For significant unresolved issues:

### Demand Letter

Send formal letter requiring:
- Specific remedy (repair or refund)
- Deadline for response (30 days)
- Statement you'll pursue legal action if not resolved
- Send certified mail with return receipt

### Small Claims Court

For disputes within your state's limit:
- No attorney required
- File in shop's county
- Present evidence to judge
- Typical limit $5,000-$15,000

### Attorney Consultation

Consider legal help when:
- Damages exceed small claims limit
- Shop is hostile or threatening
- Issues involve safety
- Fraud may be involved

## Getting Repairs Fixed Elsewhere

If the original shop won't fix problems:

### Finding a Corrective Shop

Look for:
- I-CAR Gold Class certification
- Experience fixing others' work
- Strong reviews and reputation
- Willingness to document problems
- Written estimate for corrections

### Getting Insurance to Pay

Present to your adjuster:
- Documentation of problems
- Second shop's assessment
- Estimate for corrections
- Request authorization

### If Insurance Won't Pay More

Options include:
- Negotiate partial payment

- Small claims against shop

## Special Situations

### Warranty Repairs

If shop offers warranty:
- Review warranty terms
- Make claims in writing
- Document timeline
- Escalate to owner if needed

### Manufacturer Involvement

For certified network shops:
- Contact manufacturer's customer service
- File complaint about certified shop
- May lose certification
- Manufacturer may intervene

### When Original Shop Closed

If shop has gone out of business:
- Check for successor business
- Review any bonds required
- Insurance claim may reopen
- Small claims against owner personally
