## Understanding Comparative Negligence

Comparative negligence is the legal principle that distributes fault between parties in an accident. It determines how much compensation you can recover based on your share of responsibility for the collision.

> [!INFO] Comparative negligence means your compensation is reduced by your percentage of fault. If you're 30% at fault, you recover 70% of your damages.

## The Three Major Systems

### Pure Comparative Negligence

You can recover damages even if you're mostly at fault.

**How It Works:**
- Your recovery is reduced by your fault percentage
- No threshold - recover even at 99% fault
- Most plaintiff-friendly system

**Example:** You're 80% at fault in a $100,000 accident.
- You can still recover 20% = $20,000
- Other driver can recover 80% = $80,000

**States Using Pure Comparative:**
Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Washington

### Modified Comparative Negligence (50% Bar)

You can only recover if you're LESS than 50% at fault.

**How It Works:**
- At 49% fault: Can recover (reduced by 49%)
- At 50% fault: Cannot recover anything
- At 51%+: Cannot recover anything

**Example:** $100,000 accident
- You're 49% at fault: Recover $51,000
- You're 50% at fault: Recover $0

**States Using 50% Bar:**
Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia

### Modified Comparative Negligence (51% Bar)

You can recover if you're 50% or less at fault.

**How It Works:**
- At 50% fault: Can recover (reduced by 50%)
- At 51% fault: Cannot recover anything

**Example:** $100,000 accident
- You're 50% at fault: Recover $50,000
- You're 51% at fault: Recover $0

**States Using 51% Bar:**
Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Wisconsin, Wyoming

### Pure Contributory Negligence

ANY fault bars ALL recovery.

**How It Works:**
- Even 1% fault means no recovery
- Harshest rule for accident victims
- Very few jurisdictions use this

**Example:** You're 1% at fault for accident.
- You recover $0
- All or nothing system

**Jurisdictions Using Contributory:**
Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, District of Columbia

> [!WARNING] If you're in Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, or DC, even minor fault like being 2 mph over the speed limit could eliminate your entire claim.

## How Fault Percentages Are Determined

### Who Decides?

| Stage | Who Assigns Fault |
|-------|-------------------|
| Insurance claim | Adjuster |
| Negotiation | Agreement of parties |
| Arbitration | Neutral arbitrator |
| Lawsuit | Judge or jury |

### Factors Considered

Evidence reviewed includes:
- Police report and citations
- Witness statements
- Physical evidence (damage, skid marks)
- Traffic laws violated
- Video footage
- Expert reconstruction

### Common Fault Allocations

| Scenario | Typical Fault Split |
|----------|---------------------|
| Rear-end collision | Rear driver 100%, or 80-90% if lead driver contributed |
| Left turn accident | Turner 80-100% |
| Lane change collision | Changer 70-90% |
| T-bone at intersection | Depends on who had right of way |
| Parking lot collision | Often 50/50 when disputed |

## How Comparative Negligence Affects Your Claim

### Property Damage Recovery

Your vehicle repair recovery is reduced by your fault:

| Your Damages | Your Fault | Your Recovery |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| $10,000 | 0% | $10,000 |
| $10,000 | 25% | $7,500 |
| $10,000 | 50% | $5,000 or $0* |
| $10,000 | 75% | $2,500 (pure) or $0 (modified) |

*Depends on state threshold

### Bodily Injury Recovery

Same principle applies to injury claims:

**Example:** $50,000 in medical bills, lost wages, pain and suffering
- 20% fault = $40,000 recovery
- 40% fault = $30,000 recovery
- 51% fault = $0 in most states

### Both Drivers Making Claims

When both drivers are injured and claim:

**Scenario:** $100,000 total damages each
- Driver A: 70% at fault
- Driver B: 30% at fault

**In Pure Comparative State:**
- Driver A recovers 30% = $30,000
- Driver B recovers 70% = $70,000

**In Modified Comparative State:**
- Driver A: 70% at fault = $0 recovery
- Driver B: 30% at fault = $70,000 recovery

## Strategies for Minimizing Your Fault

### At the Accident Scene

**Do:**
- Take photos of everything
- Get witness contact information
- Document traffic signals and signs
- Note road conditions
- Request police report

**Don't:**
- Admit fault ("I'm sorry" can be used against you)
- Speculate about what happened
- Discuss fault with the other driver
- Post about accident on social media

### When Dealing With Insurance

**Do:**
- Stick to facts
- Provide documentation
- Dispute incorrect assumptions
- Get everything in writing

**Don't:**
- Give recorded statement without preparation
- Accept fault percentage without evidence
- Settle quickly before understanding your damages

### Evidence That Reduces Your Fault

| Evidence Type | How It Helps |
|---------------|--------------|
| Dash cam footage | Shows what really happened |
| Witness statements | Independent verification |
| Traffic camera video | Proves right of way |
| Cell phone records | Shows other driver was distracted |
| Expert reconstruction | Analyzes physics of accident |

## Disputing Fault Percentage

### When to Challenge

Challenge the fault assessment when:
- Evidence doesn't support the percentage
- Important facts were ignored
- Assumption doesn't match reality
- Witnesses support your version
- Damage patterns contradict assessment

### How to Challenge

1. **Request detailed explanation** of how percentage was determined
2. **Provide additional evidence** supporting lower fault
3. **Point out errors** in their analysis
4. **Get expert opinion** if needed
5. **Escalate to supervisor** if adjuster won't budge
6. **Consider arbitration** or litigation

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

Is challenging worth it?

| Claim Value | Fault Difference | Value of Fight |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| $10,000 | 10% (30% vs 20%) | $1,000 |
| $50,000 | 10% | $5,000 |
| $100,000 | 10% | $10,000 |

> [!TIP] Fighting a 5% fault difference on a $5,000 claim saves $250 - probably not worth extensive effort. On a $100,000 claim, it's $5,000 - definitely worth negotiating.

## Special Situations

### Last Clear Chance Doctrine

In some states, if one driver had the "last clear chance" to avoid the accident and didn't, they may bear more responsibility.

**Example:** Driver A runs stop sign. Driver B sees A coming but doesn't brake. B had last clear chance and may share fault.

### Emergency Doctrine

Actions taken during an emergency may be judged differently:
- Sudden emergency not of your making
- Reasonable reaction under circumstances
- May reduce your fault percentage

### Seatbelt Defense

Some states reduce recovery if you weren't wearing a seatbelt:
- Injuries that seatbelt would have prevented
- Typically 5-15% reduction
- Not applicable in all states

## Joint and Several Liability

### What It Means

When multiple defendants are at fault:
- **Joint liability:** Each defendant responsible for full amount
- **Several liability:** Each responsible only for their share

### How It Affects Recovery

**Joint and Several (Traditional):**
- You can collect 100% from any defendant
- That defendant can seek contribution from others
- Protects you if one defendant has no insurance

**Several Only (Many States):**
- Each defendant pays only their percentage
- You may not recover full damages if one can't pay

## Insurance and Comparative Negligence

### Your Own Insurance

Your collision coverage pays regardless of fault:
- You pay deductible
- Insurance pays rest of repairs
- They subrogate based on fault percentages

### Other Driver's Insurance

Their liability coverage pays based on your fault:
- 0% your fault = 100% of your damages
- 30% your fault = 70% of your damages
- 51%+ your fault = $0 in most states

### Subrogation

Your insurance company recovers based on fault:
- They pay your claim
- They pursue other driver
- They recover based on fault percentage
- May refund part of your deductible

## Key Takeaways

- Comparative negligence reduces your recovery by your fault percentage
- Three systems: Pure comparative, modified comparative (50% and 51% bars), and pure contributory
- Pure comparative states let you recover even if 99% at fault
- Modified comparative states bar recovery at 50% or 51% fault
- Contributory negligence states bar any recovery if you're at all at fault
- Fight to minimize your fault percentage, especially on larger claims
- Document everything at the scene to protect your position
- The difference between 49% and 51% fault can be the difference between full recovery and nothing
