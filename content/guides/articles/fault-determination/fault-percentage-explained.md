## How Fault Percentage Works

In most accidents, fault isn't binary - it's rarely 100% one driver's fault. Insurance companies and courts often assign fault percentages to each party, which directly affects how much compensation each can recover.

> [!INFO] Fault percentage determines your compensation. If you're 20% at fault for an accident, your recovery may be reduced by 20%.

## What Fault Percentage Means

### Simple Example

You're in an accident with $10,000 in damages:

| Your Fault | Other Driver's Fault | Your Recovery |
|------------|----------------------|---------------|
| 0% | 100% | $10,000 |
| 20% | 80% | $8,000 |
| 50% | 50% | $5,000 or $0 |
| 100% | 0% | $0 |

### Who Determines Fault Percentage?

Multiple parties assess fault:
- Insurance adjusters (for claims)
- Police officers (for reports)
- Judges or juries (for lawsuits)
- Arbitrators (for disputes)

Each may reach different conclusions, and their assessments have different weight.

## State Rules That Affect Recovery

### Pure Comparative Negligence

You can recover damages even if mostly at fault.

**States:** Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Washington

**Example:** You're 80% at fault for a $100,000 accident.
- You can still recover 20% = $20,000
- (minus any damages you owe the other driver)

### Modified Comparative Negligence (50% Bar)

You can recover only if you're less than 50% at fault.

**States:** Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia

**Example:** You're 50% at fault.
- At exactly 50%: No recovery
- At 49%: Can recover (reduced by 49%)

### Modified Comparative Negligence (51% Bar)

You can recover only if you're 50% or less at fault.

**States:** Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Wisconsin, Wyoming

**Example:** You're 50% at fault.
- At 50%: Can recover (reduced by 50%)
- At 51%: No recovery

### Pure Contributory Negligence

Any fault bars all recovery.

**States:** Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, District of Columbia

**Example:** You're 1% at fault.
- No recovery at all
- Extremely harsh rule
- Some exceptions may apply

> [!WARNING] In contributory negligence states, even minor fault like going 2 mph over the speed limit could eliminate your entire claim.

## How Fault Is Assigned

### Evidence Considered

Insurance adjusters consider:
- Police report
- Witness statements
- Photos and videos
- Vehicle damage patterns
- Road conditions
- Traffic laws violated
- Cell phone records
- Dash cam footage

### Common Fault Scenarios

| Scenario | Typical Fault Assignment |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Rear-end collision | Rear driver 100% |
| Left turn accident | Turning driver 80-100% |
| Running red light | Light-runner 100% |
| Speeding + failure to yield | Split fault possible |
| Lane change collision | Lane changer 60-80% |
| Parking lot collision | Often 50/50 |

### Factors That Add Fault

Actions that increase your fault percentage:
- Speeding (even slightly)
- Distracted driving evidence
- Following too closely
- Failure to signal
- Improper lane position
- Not wearing glasses (if required)
- DUI/DWI

## Disputing Fault Percentage

### When to Challenge

Dispute the fault assessment if:
- It doesn't match the evidence
- Key facts were ignored
- Important evidence wasn't considered
- Witness statements support your version
- The percentage seems arbitrary

### How to Challenge

1. **Request detailed explanation** from adjuster
2. **Provide additional evidence** supporting your position
3. **Get witness statements** in writing
4. **Obtain expert opinions** if needed (accident reconstruction)
5. **File appeal** or request supervisor review
6. **Consider appraisal** or mediation
7. **Consult attorney** for significant claims

### Evidence That Changes Fault

New evidence can shift fault assignment:
- Dash cam footage contradicting report
- Witness who wasn't interviewed
- Traffic camera footage
- Cell phone records showing distraction
- Accident reconstruction analysis
- Medical evidence (showing impact severity)

## How Fault Affects Insurance Claims

### Your Claim Against Them

At-fault driver's liability pays your damages (reduced by your fault).

**Example:** $20,000 claim, you're 30% at fault
- Their insurance pays: $14,000
- You absorb: $6,000

### Their Claim Against You

Your liability coverage pays their damages based on your fault.

**Example:** Their $15,000 claim, you're 30% at fault
- Your insurance pays: $4,500

### Using Your Own Coverage

If you file with your own collision insurance:
- You pay deductible
- Your insurance pays repairs
- They subrogate against other driver
- Fault percentage affects subrogation recovery

## Fault and Premium Increases

### How At-Fault Accidents Affect Rates

| Your Fault Level | Premium Impact |
|------------------|----------------|
| 0% (not at fault) | Usually none |
| 1-25% | May see increase |
| 26-50% | Likely increase |
| 51%+ | Significant increase |
| 100% | Major increase |

### Surcharge Thresholds

Many insurers have fault thresholds:
- Under 50% at fault: May avoid surcharge
- 50%+ at fault: Surcharge likely
- Multiple at-fault accidents: Higher increases

## Multiple Vehicle Accidents

### Assigning Fault With Multiple Parties

In multi-vehicle accidents:
- Each driver assigned percentage
- Total equals 100%
- Each recovers based on others' combined fault

**Example:** Three-car pileup
- Driver A: 50% at fault
- Driver B: 30% at fault
- Driver C: 20% at fault

Driver C can recover from both A and B:
- From A's insurance: 50% of damages
- From B's insurance: 30% of damages
- Total recovery: 80% (reduced by own 20%)

## Negotiating Fault Percentage

### What's Negotiable

Fault percentages aren't set in stone until:
- Claim is settled and released
- Lawsuit judgment is entered
- Arbitration decision is final

### Negotiation Tactics

1. **Focus on evidence** - Facts matter more than arguments
2. **Be specific** - Point to exact evidence supporting your position
3. **Challenge assumptions** - Question how they reached their percentage
4. **Get competing estimates** - Multiple adjusters may differ
5. **Use time** - Insurers may adjust to close claims

### Knowing When to Accept

Accept the fault determination when:
- Evidence clearly supports it
- Legal costs exceed potential gain
- You need to move forward
- The percentage difference is small

> [!TIP] A 5% fault dispute on a $5,000 claim is $250 - probably not worth extensive fighting. On a $100,000 claim, it's $5,000 - worth negotiating.
