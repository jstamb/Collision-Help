## When to Dispute Fault

Insurance companies don't always get fault right. If you believe the fault determination is incorrect, you have the right to dispute it. Successful disputes can mean the difference between full compensation and getting nothing.

> [!INFO] Fault determinations are negotiable, not final. With proper evidence, you can change how fault is assigned and recover more money.

## Signs the Fault Determination is Wrong

### Red Flags

- Police report doesn't match what happened
- Adjuster didn't consider key evidence
- Witness statements were ignored
- Damage patterns contradict the determination
- Other driver changed their story
- You weren't given a chance to provide your version

### Common Errors

| Error Type | Example |
|------------|---------|
| Assumption-based | "The rear driver is always at fault" |
| Missing evidence | Dash cam footage not reviewed |
| Bias toward policyholder | Their insured favored |
| Misinterpreted damage | Conclusion doesn't match impact |
| Wrong law applied | Cited violation didn't apply |

## Building Your Case

### Step 1: Get Everything in Writing

Request from the insurance company:
- Written fault determination
- Specific reasons for the decision
- Evidence they considered
- Policy language they're applying

### Step 2: Gather Your Evidence

**Photos and Videos:**
- Scene photos
- Vehicle damage
- Skid marks
- Traffic signals/signs
- Weather conditions

**Documents:**
- Police report

- Medical records (showing impact)
- Cell phone records

### Step 3: Identify Weaknesses in Their Case

Look for:
- Contradictions in their evidence
- Evidence they ignored
- Assumptions without proof
- Witness credibility issues
- Incorrect facts in their report

## Writing Your Dispute

### Format

1. **Header:** Your information, claim number, date

3. **Summary:** Brief overview of accident from your perspective
4. **Evidence:** Point-by-point evidence supporting your position
5. **Request:** Specific outcome you're seeking
6. **Deadline:** Reasonable response timeframe

### Sample Dispute Letter

## Escalation Process

### Level 1: Adjuster

Start with your assigned adjuster:
- Present your evidence
- Request reconsideration
- Ask specific questions about their determination

### Level 2: Supervisor

If adjuster won't budge:
- Request supervisor review
- Restate your evidence
- Explain why adjuster's reasoning is flawed

### Level 3: Special Investigations

For complex disputes:
- Request SIU or senior adjuster involvement
- They handle disputed claims
- More authority to make decisions

### Level 4: Appraisal/Arbitration

If negotiations fail:
- Invoke policy appraisal clause (if applicable)
- Request binding arbitration
- Neutral third party decides

### Level 5: State Insurance Department

For bad faith handling:
- File formal complaint
- Creates regulatory record
- May prompt resolution

### Level 6: Legal Action

For significant claims:
- Consult attorney
- Small claims or civil court
- May recover attorney fees if bad faith

> [!TIP] Each escalation level adds pressure. Many disputes are resolved at Level 2 or 3 when adjusters realize you have solid evidence and won't go away.

## Specific Dispute Situations

### They Say It's Word vs. Word

**Your strategy:**
- Find independent witnesses
- Obtain traffic camera footage
- Get surveillance video from nearby businesses
- Analyze damage patterns
- Use cell phone records for distraction evidence

### They Blame You for Speeding

**Your strategy:**
- Get black box data from your car
- Analyze skid marks with expert
- Show speed wasn't excessive for conditions
- Demonstrate other driver's violation was primary cause

### They Say You Should Have Avoided It

**Your strategy:**
- Document reaction time reality
- Explain why evasion wasn't possible
- Show other driver gave no warning
- Expert testimony on human reaction limits

### Police Report Blames You

**Your strategy:**

## Getting Additional Evidence

- Submit records request immediately (footage often deleted)
- Note exact location and time

### Business Surveillance

- Identify businesses with cameras facing scene
- Ask politely for footage
- Offer to cover cost of extraction
- Act quickly - systems overwrite

### Accident Reconstruction

- Provide expert opinion on causation
- $500-5,000 typically

## When Disputes Fail

### Accept and Move On When:

### Don't Accept When:

- You have strong evidence
- Recovery amount is significant
- Principle matters (DUI, major negligence)
