## Special Rules for Parking Lots

Parking lot accidents are among the most common and most disputed collisions. Unlike roadway accidents, parking lots have unique rules, limited traffic law application, and often result in shared fault determinations.

> [!INFO] Parking lot accidents account for about 20% of all car accidents. Most involve minor damage, but fault determination can be surprisingly complex.

## Why Parking Lots Are Different

### Limited Traffic Law Application

Most traffic laws apply to public roadways:
- Stop signs in parking lots may not be legally enforceable
- Speed limits may not be posted
- Right-of-way rules are less clear
- Private property changes the rules

### Common Scenarios

| Accident Type | Frequency |
|---------------|-----------|
| Backing out collisions | 35% |
| Two cars backing out | 10% |
| Lane/aisle collisions | 25% |
| Hitting parked cars | 15% |
| Pedestrian incidents | 10% |
| Other | 5% |

## Parking Lot Right-of-Way Rules

### General Principles

Even without traffic laws, basic rules apply:
- Through lanes have priority over access lanes
- Moving cars yield to established lane position
- Backing drivers have the most responsibility
- Pedestrians have right-of-way in designated areas

### Lane Hierarchy

| Lane Type | Priority Level |
|-----------|----------------|
| Main thoroughfare | Highest |
| Feeder lanes | High |
| Parking aisles | Medium |
| Backing from spot | Lowest |

## Common Scenarios and Fault

### Scenario 1: One Car Backing Out

**Situation:** You're driving in the aisle, another car backs out of a spot and hits you.

**Typical Fault:** Backing car 80-100%

**Why:** The backing driver has the duty to ensure the path is clear. The moving driver in the aisle has established position.

**Exceptions:**
- You were speeding
- You could have avoided collision
- You saw them backing and didn't stop

### Scenario 2: Both Cars Backing Out

**Situation:** Two cars back out of opposing spots and collide.

**Typical Fault:** Usually 50/50

**Why:** Both drivers have equal duty to check. Neither has established position.

**Exceptions:**
- One was clearly out first
- One driver wasn't looking
- One was stationary when struck

### Scenario 3: Rear-End in Aisle

**Situation:** You're driving through the aisle and hit a car ahead.

**Typical Fault:** Following car usually 100%

**Why:** Same rear-end presumption as roadways.

**Exceptions:**
- Lead car backed up
- Lead car stopped suddenly for no reason
- Lead car's brake lights didn't work

### Scenario 4: Car Exiting Spot Hits Your Parked Car

**Situation:** Your car is parked, another car hits it while maneuvering.

**Typical Fault:** Moving car 100%

**Why:** You're stationary and not responsible for their error.

**Exceptions:** Almost none (unless you parked illegally blocking them)

### Scenario 5: T-Bone in Intersection

**Situation:** Two cars collide at a parking lot intersection.

**Typical Fault:** Highly fact-dependent, often 50/50

**Considerations:**
- Who had the stop sign (if any)
- Who entered intersection first
- Speed of each vehicle
- Visibility conditions

> [!TIP] In parking lot intersection disputes, the driver to the right often has the advantage, similar to uncontrolled intersection rules on roadways.

## Factors That Affect Fault

### In Your Favor

- You were in an established lane
- You were moving forward, not reversing
- You had a stop sign (other didn't)
- Witnesses support your version
- Other driver admitted fault
- Dash cam shows their error

### Against You

- You were backing up
- You were speeding
- You weren't paying attention
- You could have avoided collision
- You violated right-of-way principles
- You were in "wrong" lane direction

## Police and Parking Lots

### When Police Respond

Many departments have policies:
- Private property = limited involvement
- May only respond for injuries
- May not take a report
- May not assign fault

### What Police Can Do

- Document the accident
- Exchange information between parties
- Note basic facts
- Cite for DUI or major violations
- Provide incident number for insurance

### What Police Usually Won't Do

- Investigate fault in detail
- Issue traffic citations (no traffic laws)
- Determine who was right/wrong
- Generate detailed crash report

## Documentation Tips

### At the Scene

Parking lot accident documentation is extra important:
- **Photos of everything:** Both cars, positions, surroundings
- **Witness information:** People often won't stay
- **Store surveillance:** Note cameras immediately
- **Diagram the scene:** Show positions and movements
- **Note lane markings:** Even faded ones

### Getting Surveillance Footage

Act immediately:
1. Identify all cameras in view
2. Go inside and ask for footage
3. Request in writing if refused
4. Note store name, time, camera locations
5. Follow up within 24-48 hours

> [!WARNING] Most surveillance systems record over footage within 24-72 hours. Don't wait to request it.

## Insurance Handling

### Typical Outcomes

| Scenario | Common Result |
|----------|---------------|
| Clear liability | At-fault pays |
| Disputed | Often 50/50 |
| Both backing | 50/50 |
| Word vs word | 50/50 or deny both |

### What 50/50 Means

When insurers split fault:
- Each insurance pays own driver's damage
- Both drivers use collision coverage
- Both pay deductibles
- Both may see rate increases

### Disputing 50/50

If you believe you weren't at fault:
- Provide clear evidence (video, witnesses)
- Show other driver violated right-of-way
- Demonstrate you couldn't have avoided it
- Escalate if strong evidence exists

## Special Situations

### Hit and Run in Parking Lot

If someone hits your parked car and leaves:
- Check for witnesses
- Look for surveillance cameras
- Note any evidence (paint transfer, parts)
- File police report
- Use your collision or UM coverage

### Multi-Vehicle Incidents

Several cars involved:
- Document positions of all vehicles
- Get information from all drivers
- May have multiple at-fault parties
- Fault split among all contributors

### Pedestrian Accidents

Vehicle vs pedestrian in parking lot:
- Pedestrians generally have right-of-way
- In crosswalks, pedestrian always has priority
- Backing drivers have highest duty to watch
- Pedestrians also have duty to be aware
