## What's Causing Your Delay?

### Common Delay Reasons

**Insurance Company Issues:**
- Overloaded adjusters
- Waiting for police report
- Requesting additional documentation
- Internal approval processes
- Disputes over coverage

**External Factors:**
- Parts on backorder
- Shop schedule
- Waiting for other party's statement
- Medical treatment ongoing
- Severe weather causing claim volume spike

**Your Side:**
- Slow to provide documents
- Missed calls from adjuster
- Haven't scheduled inspection
- Delayed medical treatment
- Disputing estimate

### Red Flags for Unreasonable Delay

Contact your state insurance commissioner if:
- No contact from adjuster in 10+ days
- No response to your inquiries
- Repeated requests for same information
- Deadlines missed with no explanation
- "Still under investigation" for weeks

## How to Speed Up Your Claim

### Be Proactive

1. **Respond immediately** to all requests
2. **Have documents ready** before they ask
3. **Follow up regularly** (every 3-5 days)
4. **Use email** to create paper trail
5. **Escalate when stuck**

### Documentation Tips

Provide everything at once rather than piecemeal:
- All photos from scene
- Complete police report
- All medical records (if applicable)
- Witness statements
- Repair estimates

### Communication Best Practices

- Ask for adjuster's direct line and email
- Request timeline estimates in writing
- Document every conversation
- Send follow-up emails summarizing calls
- Ask "What else do you need from me?"

## When Delays Become Unreasonable

### Signs of Bad Faith

Insurance companies act in "bad faith" when they:
- Ignore communications for extended periods
- Make unreasonably low offers without explanation
- Deny claims without valid reason
- Miss legally required deadlines
- Misrepresent policy language

### Your Options

**Step 1: Escalate internally**
- Ask for supervisor
- Contact customer service
- File internal complaint

**Step 2: External complaint**
- State insurance department complaint
- Often prompts quick resolution
- Free to file, creates official record

**Step 3: Legal action**
- Consult attorney for bad faith claims
- May recover damages beyond original claim
- Usually last resort

## Rental Car Duration

If your policy includes rental coverage, know the limits:

### During Repairs

- Coverage typically lasts until repairs complete
- Some policies have day limits (e.g., 30 days)
- Some have dollar limits (e.g., $900 total)
- Check policy for "reasonable" repair time

### During Total Loss

- Coverage typically ends when you receive payment
- Some policies give a few extra days
- Usually 2-5 days after settlement check issued

> [!WARNING] If repairs or settlement take longer than expected, you may need to pay for rental out of pocket. Keep communication with adjuster about timeline.

## Timeline for Injury Claims

Injury claims take longer for good reasons:

### Why Longer?

- Must wait for medical treatment to conclude
- Need to know full extent of injuries
- Medical records take time to obtain
- Settlement includes future medical needs
- Often higher dollars = more scrutiny

### Typical Injury Claim Timeline

| Stage | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| Initial treatment | 0-12 weeks |
| Maximum medical improvement | 3-12 months |
| Gather records | 2-4 weeks |
| Submit demand | 1 week |
| Negotiation | 2-8 weeks |
| Settlement | 1-2 weeks |
| **Total** | **4-18 months** |

### Don't Rush Injury Settlements

Settling too quickly risks:
- Not covering future treatment
- Undiscovered injuries
- Ongoing pain not compensated
- Lost wages not accounted for
