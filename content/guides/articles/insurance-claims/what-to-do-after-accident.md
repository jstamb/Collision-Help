## Immediately After the Collision

The moments after a car accident are crucial. What you do (and don't do) in the first few minutes can significantly impact your insurance claim, your safety, and your legal position.

> [!WARNING] Safety first. If anyone is injured or the accident is blocking traffic, call 911 immediately before anything else.

## Step 1: Check for Injuries

Before worrying about your car or insurance:

1. **Check yourself** - Are you hurt? Can you move safely?
2. **Check passengers** - Ask if everyone is okay
3. **Check other vehicles** - Are other drivers/passengers injured?

### If Anyone Is Injured

- Call 911 immediately
- Don't move injured people unless there's immediate danger (fire, oncoming traffic)
- Provide first aid only if trained
- Stay with injured parties until help arrives

### If No One Is Injured

- Move vehicles out of traffic if possible
- Turn on hazard lights
- Set up flares or triangles if available

## Step 2: Move to Safety

If the accident is minor and vehicles are drivable:

- Pull to the shoulder, parking lot, or side street
- Get away from moving traffic
- Keep hazard lights on
- Stay near your vehicle but not in the roadway

> [!TIP] In many states, you're legally required to move vehicles from the roadway if the accident is minor and cars are drivable.

## Step 3: Call the Police

Even for minor accidents, a police report protects you:

- **Creates official record** of what happened
- **Documents the scene** professionally
- **May assign fault** based on evidence
- **Required by law** in many states for any injury or significant damage

### What to Tell Police

- Stick to facts: location, time, what happened
- Don't admit fault or speculate
- Point out witness locations
- Mention if you believe the other driver was distracted/impaired

### Get the Report Number

Ask the responding officer:
- Report number or case number
- Which department will have the report
- How to obtain a copy later

## Step 4: Exchange Information

Collect this information from all drivers involved:

### Required Information

| Information | Where to Find It |
|-------------|------------------|
| Full name | Driver's license |
| Phone number | Ask directly |
| Address | Driver's license |
| License number | Driver's license |
| License plate | Vehicle |
| Insurance company | Insurance card |
| Policy number | Insurance card |
| Vehicle make/model/year | Registration or vehicle |

### Also Get

- Names and contact info for passengers
- Witness names and phone numbers
- Badge number if police respond

> [!INFO] Take photos of their driver's license and insurance card with your phone - faster and more accurate than writing it down.

## Step 5: Document Everything

Your phone is your most powerful tool at an accident scene.

### Photos to Take

**The Vehicles:**
- Overall damage to all vehicles
- Close-up shots of damage
- License plates of all vehicles
- VIN numbers if visible

**The Scene:**
- Traffic signs and signals
- Skid marks or debris
- Road conditions (wet, icy, construction)
- Wide shots showing layout
- Street signs showing location

**The People:**
- Other driver (optional but useful)
- Witnesses
- Responding officers

### Notes to Make

While memory is fresh, document:
- Time of accident
- Weather conditions
- What you were doing (speed, direction)
- What other driver did
- Traffic conditions
- Any statements made by other driver

## Step 6: Don't Admit Fault

This is critical. Even if you think you might be at fault:

**Don't Say:**
- "I'm sorry" (can be interpreted as admission)
- "It was my fault"
- "I didn't see you"
- "I wasn't paying attention"

**Do Say:**
- "Are you okay?"
- "Let's exchange information"
- "The police are on the way"

> [!WARNING] Fault determination is complex. What seems obviously your fault may not be after investigation. Let insurance companies determine fault based on evidence.

## Step 7: Notify Your Insurance Company

Report the accident to your insurer promptly - even if you weren't at fault.

### When to Call

- Same day if possible
- Within 24-48 hours maximum
- Before the other driver's insurance contacts you

### What to Tell Them

- Date, time, location of accident
- Basic description of what happened
- Police report number
- Other driver's information
- Your injuries (if any)
- Description of vehicle damage

### What NOT to Say

- Don't give a recorded statement without preparation
- Don't guess at details you don't remember
- Don't minimize or exaggerate injuries
- Don't admit fault

## Step 8: Seek Medical Attention

Even if you feel fine, see a doctor within 24-72 hours:

### Why This Matters

- **Adrenaline masks pain** - Injuries may not be apparent yet
- **Delayed symptoms** - Whiplash, concussions can take days to appear
- **Creates documentation** - Medical records support injury claims
- **Insurance requirement** - Delays in treatment can hurt claims

### What to Tell Your Doctor

- That you were in a car accident
- Any pain, discomfort, or unusual symptoms
- Request thorough examination
- Ask for copies of all records

## Step 9: Keep Records

Start a claim file immediately:

**Documents to Save:**
- Police report
- Photos from scene
- Exchange information sheet
- Medical records and bills
- Repair estimates
- Rental car receipts
- Communication with insurers
- Time missed from work

**Create a Timeline:**

Date and document every interaction with insurance companies, including who you spoke with and what was discussed.
