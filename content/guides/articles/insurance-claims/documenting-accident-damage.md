## Why Documentation Matters

The evidence you collect after an accident directly affects your claim settlement. Insurance companies make decisions based on documentation - not your word alone. Thorough documentation protects you from disputes and ensures you receive fair compensation.

> [!INFO] The best time to document an accident is immediately after it happens. Evidence can disappear, memories fade, and opportunities to capture proof are lost.

## Photo Documentation

### Essential Photos to Take

**Your Vehicle:**
- All four corners (diagonal views)
- Close-ups of all damage areas
- Interior damage if any
- Dashboard showing mileage/date
- VIN plate on dashboard
- Tire damage or marks

**Other Vehicle(s):**
- Same angles as your vehicle
- License plate clearly visible
- Insurance card and registration (if shared)
- Overall vehicle photos

**The Scene:**
- Wide shot showing intersection/road
- Traffic signs and signals
- Skid marks or debris
- Road conditions
- Weather visibility
- Any obstructions to view

**Other Evidence:**
- Witnesses (ask permission)
- Responding officers
- Nearby security cameras (note locations)

### Photo Tips

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Take too many photos | Assume you have enough |
| Get multiple angles | Only photograph your car |
| Include context shots | Crop out important details |
| Capture before cleanup | Wait until scene is cleared |
| Check photo quality | Take blurry or dark photos |

> [!TIP] Use your phone's burst mode for quick capture. You can delete extras later - you can't recreate missed shots.

## Video Documentation

Video captures details photos might miss:

### What to Video

- Walk around all vehicles slowly
- Pan across the entire scene
- Capture traffic flow and signals
- Record your verbal description
- Document any unusual conditions

### Video Narration

While recording, narrate:
> "This is [date] at [time]. I was traveling [direction] on [street] when [brief description]. Here is my vehicle... the damage is to the [location]... here is the other vehicle..."

## Written Documentation

### Immediate Notes

Write down while at the scene:
- Exact time of accident
- Weather conditions
- What you were doing before impact
- What you observed the other driver doing
- Sequence of events
- Direction of travel (both vehicles)
- Traffic conditions
- Road conditions

### Witness Information

For each witness, record:
- Full name
- Phone number
- Email address
- What they saw
- Where they were standing
- Willingness to provide statement

### Police Officer Information

- Officer name and badge number
- Department name
- Report number
- Station address for report pickup
- When report will be available

## Documenting Injuries

### Physical Documentation

- Photograph visible injuries immediately
- Take photos daily as injuries develop
- Include date stamp in all photos
- Photograph from multiple angles
- Show scale (ruler or common object nearby)

### Medical Documentation

Start tracking immediately:
- Symptoms as they appear
- Pain levels (1-10 scale)
- Activities you can't perform
- Sleep difficulties
- Emotional impact

### Create an Injury Journal

Record daily:
| Date | Symptoms | Pain Level | Limitations | Medical Visits |
|------|----------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| [Date] | Neck pain, headache | 6/10 | Can't turn head fully | None |
| [Date] | Same plus back pain | 7/10 | Called in sick | Urgent care |

> [!WARNING] Delayed symptom documentation looks suspicious to insurers. Start documenting immediately, even if you feel fine at first.
