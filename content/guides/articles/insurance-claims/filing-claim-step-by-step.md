## Understanding the Claims Process

Filing an insurance claim after a car accident can feel overwhelming, but the process follows a predictable pattern. Understanding each step helps you navigate efficiently and avoid common pitfalls that delay settlements.

> [!INFO] You have two options for filing: with your own insurance (first-party claim) or with the other driver's insurance (third-party claim). This guide covers both.

## First-Party vs. Third-Party Claims

### First-Party Claim (Your Insurance)

File with your own insurance when:
- You have collision coverage
- Other driver is uninsured or unknown (hit-and-run)
- You want faster resolution
- Fault is disputed
- You need a rental car immediately

**Pros:** Faster processing, your insurer works for you
**Cons:** You pay your deductible, potential rate increase

### Third-Party Claim (Other Driver's Insurance)

File with other driver's insurance when:
- Other driver is clearly at fault
- They have valid insurance
- You want to preserve your rates
- You don't want to pay a deductible

**Pros:** No deductible, no impact on your rates
**Cons:** Slower process, other insurer doesn't represent you

## Step 1: Report the Accident

### How to Report

Most insurers offer multiple reporting methods:

| Method | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| Phone | Complex claims, injuries involved |
| Mobile app | Simple claims, photo upload |

### Information You'll Need

Have this ready before calling:
- Policy number
- Date, time, and location of accident
- Police report number (if available)

### What to Say

Be factual and concise:

- Request copy of damage assessment

### After Inspection

You'll receive:
- **Estimate of damages** - What they'll pay for repairs

- **Next steps** - Repair authorization or settlement

## Step 5: Review the Estimate

The initial estimate may not cover everything:

### If Using Non-Preferred Shop

- Insurance must still pay reasonable costs
