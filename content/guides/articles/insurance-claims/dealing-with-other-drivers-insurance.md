## Understanding Third-Party Claims

When another driver is at fault for your accident, you'll likely deal with their insurance company. This is called a third-party claim. Unlike your own insurer, the other driver's insurance company doesn't work for you - they work to minimize their payout.

> [!WARNING] The other driver's insurance company is not on your side. Their goal is to settle your claim for as little as possible.

## Should You File With Their Insurance or Yours?

### File With Their Insurance (Third-Party) When:

- Other driver is clearly at fault
- You don't have collision coverage
- You want to avoid a deductible
- You don't want potential rate increase
- Damage is minor and straightforward

### File With Your Insurance (First-Party) When:

- Fault is disputed
- You need faster resolution
- Other driver may be uninsured
- You want your insurer advocating for you
- Rental car needed immediately

> [!TIP] You can file with both insurers and let them sort out fault between themselves. Your insurance may seek reimbursement from the at-fault party's insurer.

## The Third-Party Claims Process

### Step 1: Gather Other Driver's Information

At the accident scene, collect:
- Insurance company name
- Policy number
- Driver's full name
- Driver's phone number
- Claims phone number (from insurance card)

### Step 2: Report to Their Insurance

Call the other driver's insurance company:
- Provide accident details
- Give your contact information
- Request a claim number
- Ask for adjuster assignment timeline

**What to say:**
> "I was involved in an accident with your policyholder [name] on [date]. I'd like to file a claim for damages to my vehicle and [any injuries]. The police report number is [number]."

### Step 3: Wait for Contact

Their adjuster will contact you:
- Usually within 3-5 business days
- Will want your statement
- May schedule vehicle inspection
- Will explain their process

## Handling the Recorded Statement

The other driver's insurance will request a recorded statement. This is different from talking to your own insurer.

### Know Your Rights

- **You're not required to give a recorded statement** to the other party's insurer
- You can decline or delay until you're ready
- You can have an attorney present
- You can set limitations on questions

### If You Give a Statement

**Preparation:**
- Review your notes and photos
- Write down key facts
- Practice what you'll say
- Know what NOT to say

**During the statement:**
- Stick to facts only
- Don't speculate or guess
- Say "I don't know" if uncertain
- Don't minimize injuries
- Don't admit any fault
- Keep answers brief

**Phrases to avoid:**
- "I think maybe I could have..."
- "I probably should have..."
- "I'm not really hurt, just a little sore"
- "It was partly my fault"

> [!WARNING] Anything you say can be used to reduce your settlement. The adjuster may seem friendly, but they're looking for ways to minimize the claim.

## Negotiating With Their Adjuster

### What They're Trained to Do

Insurance adjusters are skilled at:
- Building rapport to get you talking
- Asking leading questions
- Finding inconsistencies
- Minimizing injury severity
- Making quick low offers

### Counter-Strategies

- **Be polite but not chatty** - Don't volunteer information
- **Stick to facts** - No opinions or speculation
- **Don't accept first offers** - They're always low
- **Get everything in writing** - Verbal promises mean nothing
- **Set deadlines** - "I need a response by [date]"

## Common Tactics and How to Respond

### "We need a recorded statement before proceeding"

**Response:** "I'll provide a written statement of the facts. I'm not comfortable with a recording."

### "Our investigation shows shared fault"

**Response:** "I disagree. Here's the police report showing [their driver] was cited for [violation]. I'd like to see your evidence."

### "That's our final offer"

**Response:** "I don't believe that represents fair compensation. Let me share comparable repair estimates and medical documentation that support a higher value."

### "You need to settle quickly or the offer expires"

**Response:** "I'm not going to be rushed into a decision. A fair settlement doesn't have arbitrary deadlines."

### "You didn't need all that medical treatment"

**Response:** "My doctor determined what treatment was necessary. Here's the documentation supporting medical necessity."

## Getting Fair Compensation

### For Vehicle Damage

Ensure they cover:
- Full repair costs (not just their estimate)
- OEM parts if appropriate
- Rental car during repairs
- Diminished value (in some states)

### For Injuries

Document and claim:
- All medical bills
- Future medical treatment if needed
- Lost wages (past and future)
- Pain and suffering
- Out-of-pocket expenses

### For Total Loss

Negotiate for:
- Fair actual cash value
- Sales tax reimbursement
- Registration/title fees
- Rental until settlement
- Personal property in vehicle

## What If They Deny Your Claim?

### Common Denial Reasons

- Policy wasn't in effect
- Driver wasn't covered
- Excluded incident type
- Dispute over fault
- Late reporting

### Your Options

1. **Request written denial** with specific reasons
2. **Review their policy** (you can request relevant sections)
3. **Challenge disputed facts** with evidence
4. **File with your own insurance** if you have collision coverage
5. **Consult an attorney** for larger claims
6. **File complaint** with state insurance department
7. **Small claims court** for smaller disputes

## When Their Insurance Won't Pay Enough

### Negotiation Strategies

1. **Document your damages** comprehensively
2. **Get multiple repair estimates**
3. **Compile medical records and bills**
4. **Calculate lost wages with documentation**
5. **Research comparable vehicle values**
6. **Write a demand letter** with specific amount
7. **Be patient** - don't accept too quickly

### Demand Letter Elements

Your written demand should include:
- Date and description of accident
- Statement of other driver's fault
- Description of your injuries
- List of medical treatment
- Medical bills total
- Lost wage calculation
- Property damage details
- Specific settlement amount requested
- Deadline for response

## Using Your Own Insurance as Leverage

Even if other driver is at fault, filing with your insurer provides:

- **Faster processing** - They work for you
- **Deductible recovery** - They'll seek reimbursement
- **Rate protection** - Not-at-fault claims often don't raise rates
- **Rental coverage** - Immediate access
- **Leverage** - Two insurance companies pursuing at-fault driver

### Subrogation: Getting Your Deductible Back

When you use your collision coverage:
- You pay your deductible
- Your insurer pays the rest
- Your insurer pursues at-fault party's insurance
- If successful, you get deductible back

> [!INFO] Subrogation can take months, but many insurers are successful at recovering. Ask about your insurer's subrogation success rate.

## Red Flags for Bad Faith

Watch for these warning signs:
- Unreasonable delays
- Refusing to explain denials
- Ignoring evidence you provide
- Making lowball offers repeatedly
- Missing legal deadlines
- Misrepresenting coverage

## When to Hire an Attorney

Consider legal help when:
- Injuries are significant
- Treatment is ongoing
- Liability is disputed
- Insurance is denying valid claim
- Offers are unreasonably low
- You're uncomfortable negotiating
- Claim value exceeds $10,000
