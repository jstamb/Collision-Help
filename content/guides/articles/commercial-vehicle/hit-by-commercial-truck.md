## Hit by a Commercial Truck: What You Need to Know

Accidents involving commercial trucks are fundamentally different from car-to-car collisions. The size disparity, federal regulations, and corporate entities involved create unique challenges and opportunities for your claim.

> [!INFO] Commercial truck accidents often involve multiple liable parties, larger insurance policies, and federal regulations that can strengthen your claim if violated.

## Why Truck Accidents Are Different

### Size and Force

Commercial trucks create devastating impacts:

| Vehicle Type | Typical Weight |
|--------------|----------------|
| Passenger car | 3,000-4,000 lbs |
| SUV | 4,500-6,000 lbs |
| Semi-truck (loaded) | 80,000 lbs |

**Impact implication:** A loaded semi at highway speed has 20-25 times the force of a passenger car.

### Severity of Injuries

Truck accidents often cause:
- Traumatic brain injuries
- Spinal cord injuries
- Multiple fractures
- Internal organ damage
- Amputations
- Fatalities

### Multiple Parties Involved

Potential defendants:
- Truck driver
- Trucking company
- Truck owner (if different from company)
- Cargo loader
- Maintenance company
- Parts manufacturer
- Broker who arranged load

## Federal Regulations Apply

### FMCSA Rules

Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration regulates:
- Driver qualifications
- Hours of service
- Vehicle maintenance
- Cargo securement
- Drug and alcohol testing
- Electronic logging devices (ELD)

### Hours of Service (HOS) Violations

Drivers are limited to:
- 11 hours driving after 10 hours off
- 14-hour window for driving
- 30-minute break after 8 hours
- 60/70-hour weekly limits

**Violations indicate:** Fatigued driving, negligent company policies.

### Electronic Logging Devices (ELD)

Since 2019:
- Most trucks must have ELDs
- Automatically track driving time
- Harder to falsify logs
- Evidence of HOS violations

> [!TIP] ELD data is crucial evidence. Your attorney should immediately request preservation of all electronic logs before they're overwritten or deleted.
