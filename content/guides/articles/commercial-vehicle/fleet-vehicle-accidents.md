## Fleet Vehicle Accidents

Fleet vehicles - company-owned cars, vans, and trucks used by employees - are involved in millions of accidents annually. When you're hit by a fleet vehicle, or you're an employee in a fleet accident, understanding the unique liability and insurance aspects helps protect your interests.

> [!INFO] Fleet vehicle accidents typically give injured parties access to corporate insurance policies with higher limits and additional coverage options beyond personal auto policies.
