## Uber and Lyft Accidents

Rideshare accidents create unique liability challenges. Whether you're a passenger, another driver, or a pedestrian injured in an Uber or Lyft accident, understanding how insurance works and who's responsible is crucial for your claim.

### Filing Your Claim

**If your driver caused accident:**
