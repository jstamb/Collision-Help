## Trucking Regulations and Your Accident Claim

Federal trucking regulations create a roadmap for proving negligence in truck accident cases. When trucking companies or drivers violate these rules, it strengthens your claim significantly. Understanding key regulations helps you and your attorney build a stronger case.

> [!INFO] Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulations are safety rules, and violating them is strong evidence of negligence in accident cases.

## Who Must Follow FMCSA Regulations

### Commercial Motor Vehicles (CMVs)

FMCSA regulates vehicles that:
- Weigh 10,001+ pounds

- Transport hazardous materials
- Operate across state lines

### Covered Entities

Regulations apply to:
- Trucking companies (motor carriers)
- Commercial truck drivers
- Owner-operators
- Brokers and freight forwarders
- Equipment manufacturers

### What This Means for Your Case

If the truck that hit you is covered:
- Multiple regulations may have been violated

| On-duty limit | 14-hour window |
| Required break | 30 minutes after 8 hours |
| Weekly limit | 60/70 hours in 7/8 days |
| Reset requirement | 34 consecutive hours off |

### How Violations Happen

Drivers exceed limits due to:
- Delivery pressure

### Proving HOS Violations

Evidence available:
- Electronic logging device (ELD) data
- Driver's duty status records
- Dispatch records
- GPS and telematics data
- Delivery receipts

> [!TIP] ELD data is gold in truck accident cases. Request its preservation immediately - it can prove the driver was fatigued or exceeded legal driving limits.

## Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs)

### ELD Mandate

Since December 2019:
- Most commercial trucks must have ELDs
- Automatically records driving time
- Connected to vehicle engine
- Hard to falsify

### What ELDs Record

Data captured:
- Engine on/off times
- Vehicle movement
- Miles driven
- Location (GPS)
- Driver login/logout
- On-duty status changes

### Obtaining ELD Data

For your case:
- Attorney sends preservation letter immediately
- Subpoena through litigation
- Data may be overwritten if not preserved
- Shows exactly what driver was doing

## Driver Qualification Files

### Required Documents

### What This Means for Your Case

These records show:
- Prior accidents

- Citation issued AND injury requiring medical treatment
- Citation issued AND vehicle towed

### Testing Windows

| Drug | Within 32 hours of accident |

### Using Test Results

In your case:
- Positive test is strong evidence
- Failure to test may indicate cover-up
- Request test results through discovery

> [!WARNING] If the trucking company failed to conduct required post-accident drug/alcohol testing, it may indicate they knew or suspected the driver was impaired and wanted to hide it.
