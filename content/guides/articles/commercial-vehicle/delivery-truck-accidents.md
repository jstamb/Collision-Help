## Delivery Truck Accidents

With the explosion of online shopping, delivery trucks are everywhere. From Amazon vans to FedEx trucks to local delivery services, these vehicles are involved in thousands of accidents daily. Understanding who's liable and how to pursue your claim is essential.

> [!INFO] Delivery truck accidents may involve the driver, the delivery company, a contractor, or multiple parties depending on the employment structure and circumstances.

## Types of Delivery Vehicles

### Major Carriers

|---------|---------------|
| UPS | Package cars, tractor trailers |
| FedEx | Vans, trucks, contractors |

| DHL | Vans, trucks |

### Local Delivery

### The Contractor Question

Many delivery drivers are:
- Independent contractors, not employees
- Working through third-party logistics
- Using personal vehicles
- Subject to different liability rules

## Common Accident Scenarios

### Backing and Parking Accidents

Delivery trucks frequently:
- Double-park
- Block driveways
- Back into traffic
- Pull out without looking

**Typical fault:** Driver and company

### Speeding/Rushing

Pressure to meet quotas:
- Running stop signs
- Speeding in neighborhoods
- Cutting corners literally
- Unsafe lane changes

**Typical fault:** Driver and possibly company policy

### Distracted Driving

## Determining Liability

### The Employment Question

Who's liable depends on status:

| Status | Who's Liable |
|--------|--------------|
| Employee | Driver AND company |
| Independent contractor | Primarily driver |
| Contractor with company vehicle | Complex - often both |
| Gig worker (personal vehicle) | Primarily driver |

### Respondeat Superior

When driver is employee:
- Company liable for actions during work
- "Scope of employment" key question
- Even if driver violated policy

### Independent Contractor Shield

Companies try to avoid liability by:
- Classifying drivers as contractors
- Requiring separate insurance
- Claiming no control over drivers

**Reality:** Many courts pierce this defense when company controls:
- Schedules
- Routes
- Uniforms
- Vehicle branding
- Performance metrics

> [!TIP] Just because a delivery company calls their drivers "independent contractors" doesn't mean they avoid liability. The actual level of control matters more than the label.

## Amazon Delivery Accidents

### Complex Structure

Amazon uses:
- Amazon employees (rare)
- Delivery Service Partners (DSPs)
- Amazon Flex (personal vehicles)
- USPS, UPS, FedEx partnerships

### DSP Model

Delivery Service Partners:
- Small companies contracted by Amazon
- Own the vans (leased from Amazon)

### Amazon's Liability

Arguments for Amazon liability:
- Controls routes and schedules

- Monitors through technology

### Suing Amazon

Challenges:
- Amazon claims DSPs are independent
- Must prove Amazon's control
- Litigation is complex
- But settlements can be substantial

## FedEx Accidents

### Two Types of Drivers

**FedEx Express:** Employees
- Company liable directly
- Clear vicarious liability

**FedEx Ground:** Contractors
- More complex liability
- Must often sue contractor AND FedEx
- Argue FedEx control creates liability

### Insurance Requirements

FedEx Ground contractors:
- Must carry significant insurance
- FedEx monitors compliance
- Multiple insurance sources possible

## UPS Accidents

### Generally Employees

Most UPS drivers are:
- Unionized employees
- Clearly UPS's responsibility

- Settles reasonable claims

## Food and Gig Delivery Accidents

### DoorDash, Uber Eats, Instacart

These drivers:
- Use personal vehicles
- Are independent contractors
- Have their own personal insurance

### Insurance Gaps

Personal auto policies:
- Often exclude commercial use

Gig companies provide:
