## Taxi Accident Claims

Taxi accidents involve commercial vehicles with specific insurance requirements and liability rules. Whether you're a taxi passenger, another driver hit by a taxi, or a pedestrian injured by one, understanding these unique factors helps you pursue fair compensation.

> [!INFO] Taxi companies are "common carriers" and owe passengers the highest duty of care. This higher standard makes it easier to prove negligence in taxi accident cases.
