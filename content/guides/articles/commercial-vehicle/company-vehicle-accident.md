## Accident in a Company Vehicle

If you're in an accident while driving a company vehicle - or you're hit by someone driving one - the liability, insurance, and claim process differ from typical car accidents. Understanding these differences protects your interests and helps you navigate the claim.

> [!INFO] Employers are typically liable for accidents their employees cause while driving company vehicles for work purposes. This is called "vicarious liability."

## When You're Hit by a Company Vehicle

### Employer Liability

The company is usually liable when their employee:
- Was working at the time
- Was using company vehicle for work
- Was within "scope of employment"
- Was on a work errand

### What "Scope of Employment" Means

Employer is liable if driver was:
- Performing job duties
- Running work errands
- Traveling between work sites
- Making deliveries

**May not be liable if driver was:**
- On personal errand
- Significantly deviating from route
- Commuting (usually)
- Off the clock entirely

### Benefits of Employer Liability

| Advantage | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| Larger insurance | Companies carry more coverage |
| Deep pockets | Company can pay judgment |
| Professional adjuster | More likely to settle |
| Multiple defendants | More recovery options |

## Filing Against the Company

### Identify the Company

At the scene, document:
- Company name on vehicle
- Fleet number
- Driver's employer
- Business address
- Driver's name and contact

### Who to Sue/Claim Against

You can file against:
- The driver personally
- The company as employer
- Both (most common approach)

### Insurance Sources

Company vehicles typically have:
- Commercial auto policy
- Umbrella/excess coverage
- Sometimes multiple policies

> [!TIP] Commercial auto policies usually have higher limits than personal policies. A company vehicle accident may give you access to $1 million or more in coverage.

## When You're Driving the Company Vehicle

### Your Employer's Insurance Applies

When driving for work:
- Company's commercial policy covers accident
- You're typically covered as driver
- Company's liability protects you

### If You Caused the Accident

**For the other driver's damages:**
- Company insurance pays
- You're not personally liable (usually)
- Unless you were extremely reckless

**For your injuries:**
- Worker's compensation applies
- Not a typical auto claim
- Can't sue employer in most states

### If Another Driver Caused It

**For your injuries:**
- Worker's comp for injuries
- May have third-party claim against other driver
- Complex interaction of systems

**For vehicle damage:**
- Other driver's liability insurance
- Or company's collision coverage

## Employee Protections

### Indemnification

Most employers must:
- Defend you against claims
- Pay any judgment against you
- Cover your legal costs

**Exception:** If you acted outside scope or were grossly negligent.

### Discipline vs. Legal Liability

Separate issues:
- Company may fire you for accident
- But still must cover liability
- Employment consequences vs. insurance

### Commercial Driver's License (CDL)

If you hold a CDL:
- Accidents affect your CDL record
- Points may apply
- Serious violations have consequences
- May affect future employment

> [!WARNING] Even if your employer's insurance covers the accident, you may face employment consequences including termination. Document everything and consider consulting an attorney.

## Personal Vehicle for Work

## Borrowed Company Vehicles

### Permissive Use

If company let you borrow vehicle:
