    "faq1Q": "How are car accident settlements calculated?",
    "faq1A": "Car accident settlements are typically calculated by adding up all your economic damages (medical bills, lost wages, property damage) and then multiplying by a factor of 1.5 to 5 to account for pain and suffering. The multiplier depends on injury severity—minor injuries use lower multipliers, while severe or permanent injuries use higher ones. This gives you an estimated settlement range, though actual amounts vary based on liability, insurance limits, and negotiation.",
    "faq2Q": "What is the average settlement for a car accident?",
    "faq2A": "Average car accident settlements vary widely based on injury severity. Minor injuries like whiplash typically settle for $10,000-$25,000. Moderate injuries involving some medical treatment average $25,000-$100,000. Severe injuries requiring surgery or extended treatment can range from $100,000 to $500,000 or more. Cases involving permanent disability or wrongful death often exceed $1 million. These are general ranges—your specific case depends on medical costs, lost income, liability, and available insurance coverage.",
    "faq3Q": "What factors affect car accident settlement amounts?",
    "faq3A": "Key factors include: injury severity and required treatment, total medical expenses, lost wages and future earning capacity, property damage, evidence of fault, available insurance coverage, permanent impairment or disability, impact on daily life, documentation quality, and the jurisdiction where the accident occurred. Cases with clear liability (like rear-end collisions) and well-documented injuries typically result in higher settlements.",
    "faq4Q": "How long does it take to get a car accident settlement?",
    "faq4A": "Simple cases with minor injuries and clear liability may settle in 2-4 months. Moderate injury cases typically take 6-12 months. Severe injury cases often require 1-2 years or longer, especially if litigation is involved. Factors affecting timeline include: reaching maximum medical improvement, gathering all documentation, negotiation process, and whether a lawsuit becomes necessary.",
    "faq5Q": "Should I accept the insurance company's first offer?",
    "faq5A": "Generally, no. First offers are typically lowball offers designed to settle cheaply. Insurance adjusters often offer 25-50% less than what a claim is actually worth. Before accepting, ensure you've reached maximum medical improvement, gathered all bills and documentation, calculated lost wages, and considered future medical needs. Consulting with a personal injury attorney (usually free) can help you understand if an offer is fair.",
    "faq6Q": "What is pain and suffering worth in a settlement?",
    "faq6A": "Pain and suffering is typically calculated using a multiplier method (1.5x to 5x your economic damages) or a per diem method (daily rate × days of recovery). Minor soft tissue injuries might use a 1.5-2x multiplier. Moderate injuries with some lasting effects use 2-3x. Severe injuries with significant impact use 3-4x. Permanent or catastrophic injuries may use 5x or higher. Documented pain levels, treatment duration, and impact on quality of life all affect this calculation.",
    "faq7Q": "Do I need a lawyer to get a fair settlement?",
    "faq7A": "While not required, statistics show that accident victims represented by attorneys typically receive 3-4 times higher settlements than those who negotiate alone, even after attorney fees. Attorneys are particularly valuable for: serious injuries, disputed liability, uncooperative insurance companies, complex medical situations, and cases involving multiple parties. Most personal injury attorneys offer free consultations and work on contingency (no upfront cost).",
    "faq8Q": "What if my medical bills exceed the at-fault driver's insurance limits?",
    "faq8A": "If the at-fault driver's insurance is insufficient, you have several options: file a claim with your own underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage, use your health insurance or MedPay coverage, sue the at-fault driver personally (though collecting may be difficult), or negotiate medical liens with providers. Having adequate UIM coverage on your own policy is the best protection against underinsured drivers."

          "faq2Q": "Can I claim for an accident caused by rain or ice?",
          "faq2A": "Yes, but liability depends on the circumstances. Another driver may be at fault if they were driving too fast for conditions. Road authorities can sometimes be liable for failing to treat icy roads or fix drainage issues.",
          "faq3Q": "Does weather affect my settlement amount?",
          "faq3A": "It can. If weather was a contributing factor and the other driver should have adjusted their driving, it strengthens your case. Insurance adjusters consider whether reasonable precautions were taken.",
          "faq4Q": "What if I hit someone because I hydroplaned?",
          "faq4A": "You may be found at fault. Courts generally hold that drivers should slow down in wet conditions. However, if a road defect (poor drainage, standing water) contributed, you might have a claim against the road authority."

          "faq2A": "Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Utah have no-fault systems. Puerto Rico also uses no-fault. Requirements and thresholds vary by state.",
          "faq3Q": "Can I sue in a no-fault state?",
          "faq3A": "Yes, but only if injuries meet a threshold. States use either a monetary threshold (medical bills exceed a certain amount) or verbal threshold (specific serious injuries like fractures, permanent injury, or disfigurement).",
          "faq4Q": "How does comparative negligence affect my claim?",
          "faq4A": "In pure comparative states, you can recover damages minus your fault percentage (even at 99% fault). In modified comparative states, you can't recover if you're more than 50% (or 51%) at fault. A few states still use contributory negligence where any fault bars recovery.",
          "faq5Q": "What is the statute of limitations for car accidents?",
          "faq5A": "Most states allow 2-3 years to file a lawsuit after a car accident. Some states have shorter deadlines (1 year in Kentucky and Louisiana). Claims against government entities often have much shorter notice requirements (sometimes 30-180 days)."

The ACV represents what your car was worth immediately before the accident, considering factors like age, mileage, condition, and local market prices.",

    "faq1Q": "What does 'total loss' mean for a car?",
    "faq1A": "A total loss occurs when the cost to repair your vehicle exceeds a certain percentage of its actual cash value (ACV). Most insurance companies use a threshold between 70-80%, though some states have specific laws. When your car is declared a total loss, the insurance company will pay you the vehicle's ACV minus your deductible instead of paying for repairs.",
    "faq2Q": "How do insurance companies calculate total loss value?",
    "faq2A": "Insurance companies calculate total loss value using your vehicle's Actual Cash Value (ACV), which considers the pre-accident market value, mileage, condition, optional equipment, and recent comparable sales in your area. They typically use valuation services like CCC, Mitchell, or Audatex to determine this value.",
    "faq3Q": "Can I dispute a total loss settlement offer?",
    "faq3A": "Yes, you can and should dispute a low total loss offer. Gather evidence including recent comparable sales from sites like Kelley Blue Book, Edmunds, and local dealer listings. Document any upgrades or recent maintenance. You can also hire an independent appraiser or file a complaint with your state's insurance commissioner.",
    "faq4Q": "What is the total loss threshold in my state?",
    "faq4A": "Total loss thresholds vary by state, typically ranging from 70% to 100% of the vehicle's ACV. Some states use a Total Loss Formula (TLF) where repair cost + salvage value must exceed the ACV. Check your state's specific regulations or ask your insurance company for the threshold they use.",
    "faq5Q": "Do I get to keep my car if it's totaled?",
    "faq5A": "In most cases, yes, you can keep your totaled car by accepting a reduced settlement (the ACV minus salvage value). You'll receive a salvage title, which affects future resale value and may require a rebuilt title inspection before the car can be legally driven again. Some states don't allow this option for severely damaged vehicles.",
    "faq6Q": "How long does the total loss settlement process take?",
    "faq6A": "The total loss settlement process typically takes 2-4 weeks from the date of the accident. This includes the initial inspection (1-3 days), valuation process (3-5 days), negotiation period (varies), and payment processing (3-7 days). Complex cases or disputes can extend this timeline significantly.",
    "faq7Q": "Will gap insurance help if my car is totaled?",
    "faq7A": "Yes, gap insurance covers the difference between what you owe on your car loan and what the insurance company pays for the total loss. This is especially valuable for new cars that depreciate quickly or if you made a small down payment. Gap insurance is typically purchased when you buy or lease the vehicle.",
    "faq8Q": "What happens to my car loan if my car is totaled?",
    "faq8A": "You're still responsible for paying off your car loan even if your car is totaled. The insurance settlement goes first to your lienholder (the bank or finance company). If the settlement doesn't cover the full loan balance, you'll owe the difference unless you have gap insurance."
